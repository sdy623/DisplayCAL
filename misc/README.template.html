			<h2>About dispcalGUI</h2>		

			<p>dispcalGUI is a graphical user interface for the display calibration and profiling tools of <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a>, an open source color management system by Graeme Gill.</p>

			<p>Calibrate and characterize your display devices using one of the <a href="#instruments">many supported hardware sensors</a>, with support for multi-display setups and a variety of available settings like customizable whitepoint, luminance, black level, tone response curve as well as the option to create matrix and look-up-table ICC profiles, with optional gamut mapping. Other features include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Support of colorimeter correction for wide-gamut screens via <em>correction matrices</em> or <em>calibration specral sample</em> files (the latter only for specific colorimeters i.e. i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4).</li>
				<li>Profile verification: Check the quality of profiles via measurements. Also supports custom CGATS files (e.g. FOGRA, GRACoL/IDEAlliance, SWOP) and using of reference profiles to obtain test values.</li>
				<li>Test chart editor: Create charts with any amount of color patches, easy copy &amp; paste from CGATS, CSV files (only tab-delimited) and spreadsheet applications.</li>
			</ul>

						<p>Packages made for older distributions may work on newer distributions as long as nothing substantial has changed (i.e. Python version). Also there are several distributions out there that are based on one in the above list (e.g. Linux Mint which is based on Ubuntu). This means that packages for that base distribution should also work on derivatives, you just need to know which version the derivative is based upon and pick your download accordingly.</p>

						<p>In all other cases, you can try one of these universal installs that should work on a multitude of distributions:</p>
						<p><a href="http://dispcalGUI.hoech.net/download/dispcalGUI.package">Autopackage (Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, x86 and x86_64)</a></p>
						<p><a href="http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/0install/dispcalGUI.xml">0install feed (Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, x86 and x86_64)</a></p>
						<p>To use the 0install feed, you need <a href="http://0install.net">0install</a> (“zero install”). This should be available through the package manager of your distribution.</p>

				<h3>Argyll CMS</h3>

				<p>To use dispcalGUI, you need to download and install <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a> (1.0 or newer).</p>
			</div>

			<div id="instruments">
				<h3>Supported instruments</h3>

				<p>You need one of the supported instruments to make measurements. All instruments supported by Argyll CMS are also supported by dispcalGUI. For display readings, these currently are:</p>

				<h4>Colorimeters</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Calman X2 (treated as i1 Display 2)</li>
					<li>Datacolor/ColorVision Spyder 2</li>
					<li>Datacolor Spyder 3 (since Argyll CMS 1.1.0)</li>
					<li>Datacolor Spyder 4 (since Argyll CMS 1.3.6)</li>
					<li>HP Advanced Profiling Solution (treated as i1 Display 2)</li>
					<li>HP DreamColor (treated as i1 Display 2)</li>
					<li>Hughski ColorHug (experimental only, does not work reliably on all platforms, especially on Mac OS X. Linux support since Argyll CMS 1.3.6, Windows support with newest ColorHug firmware since Argyll CMS 1.5.0)</li>
					<li>Lacie Blue Eye (treated as i1 Display 2)</li>
					<li>Sequel Imaging MonacoOPTIX (treated as i1 Display 1)</li>
					<li>X-Rite ColorMunki Create (treated as i1 Display 2)</li>
					<li>X-Rite ColorMunki Smile (since Argyll CMS 1.5.0)</li>
					<li>X-Rite DTP92</li>
					<li>X-Rite DTP94</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth/Pantone Huey</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1 Display 1</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1 Display 2/LT</li>
					<li>X-Rite i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display (since Argyll CMS 1.3.4)</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Spectrometers</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>JETI specbos 1211/1201 (new in Argyll CMS 1.6.0 beta)</li>
					<li>X-Rite ColorMunki Design, ColorMunki Photo (since Argyll CMS 1.1.0)</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1 Monitor (since Argyll CMS 1.0.3)</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1 Pro</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth Spectrolino</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Note that the <em>i1 Display Pro</em> and <em>i1 Pro</em> are very different instruments despite their naming similarities.</p>

				<p>Also there are currently (2011-09-02) four instruments (or rather, packages) under the ColorMunki brand, two of which are spectrometers, and two are colorimeters:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>ColorMunki Design</em> and <em>ColorMunki Photo</em> spectrometers differ only in the functionality of the bundled vendor software. There are no differences between the instruments when used with Argyll CMS and dispcalGUI.</li>
					<li>The <em>ColorMunki Display</em> colorimeter is a less expensive version of the i1 Display Pro colorimeter. It comes bundled with a simpler vendor software and has longer measurement times compared to the i1 Display Pro. Apart from that, the instrument appears to be virtually identical.</li>
					<li>The <em>ColorMunki Create</em> colorimeter is the same instrument as the i1 Display 2.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div id="requirements-unattended">
				<h3>Additional requirements for unattended calibration and profiling</h3>

				<p>When using a spectrometer that is supported by the unattended feature (see below), having to take the instrument off the screen to do a sensor self-calibration again after display calibration before starting the measurements for profiling may be avoided if the menu item “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” in the “Options” menu is checked (colorimeter measurements are always unattended because they generally do not require a sensor calibration away from the screen, with the exception of the i1 Display 1).</p>

				<p>Unattended calibration and profiling currently supports the following spectrometers in addition to most colorimeters:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>X-Rite ColorMunki</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1 Monitor &amp; Pro</li>
					<li>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth Spectrolino</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Be aware you may still be forced to do a sensor calibration if the instrument requires it. Also, please look at the possible <a href="#issue-samplereadfail">caveats</a>.</p>

					<p>Starting with dispcalGUI 0.2.5b, you can use standard distutils/setuptools commands with setup.py to build, install, and create packages. <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> will compile the extension modules and do a standard installation. Run <code>python setup.py --help</code> or <code>python setup.py --help-commands</code> for more information. A few additional commands and options which are not part of distutils or setuptools (and thus do not appear in the help) are also available:</p>

					<h4>Additional setup commands</h4>
					<div class="info">
						<dl>
							<dt><code>bdist_appdmg</code> (Mac OS X only)</dt>
								<dd>Creates a DMG of a previously created (by the py2app or bdist_standalone commands) application bundle.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_deb</code> (Linux/Debian-based)</dt>
								<dd>Create an installable Debian (.deb) package, much like the standard distutils command bdist_rpm for RPM packages. Prerequisites:
								You first need to install alien and rpmdb, create a dummy RPM database via <code>sudo rpmdb --initdb</code>, then edit (or create from scratch) the setup.cfg (you can have a look at misc/setup.ubuntu9.cfg for a working example). Under Ubuntu, running utils/dist_ubuntu.sh will automatically use the correct setup.cfg. If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or any other debian-based distribution which has Python 2.7 as default, you need to edit /usr/lib/python2.7/distutils/command/bdist_rpm.py, and change the line <code>install_cmd = ('%s install <span style="color: #c00">-O1</span> --root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT '</code> to <code>install_cmd = ('%s install --root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT '</code> by removing the <code><span style="color: #c00">-O1</span></code> flag. Also, you need to change /usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress to do nothing (e.g. change the file contents to <code>exit 0</code>, but don't forget to create a backup copy first) otherwise you will get errors when building.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_standalone</code></dt>
								<dd>Creates a standalone executable that does not require a Python installation. Uses bbfreeze on Linux, py2app on Mac OS X and py2exe on Windows. setup.py will try and automatically download/install these packages for you if they are not yet installed and if not using the --use-distutils switch. Note: On Mac OS X, older versions of py2app (before 0.4) are not able to access files inside python “egg” files (which are basically ZIP-compressed folders). Setuptools, which is needed by py2app, will normally be installed in “egg” form, thus preventing those older py2app versions from accessing its contents. To fix this, you need to remove any installed setuptools-&lt;version&gt;-py&lt;python-version&gt;.egg files from your Python installation's site-packages directory (normally found under <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib</code>). Then, run <code>sudo python util/ez_setup.py -Z setuptools</code> which will install setuptools unpacked, thus allowing py2app to acces all its files. This is no longer an issue with py2app 0.4 and later.</dd>
							<dt><code>buildservice</code></dt>
								<dd>Creates control files for openSUSE Build Service (also happens implicitly when invoking <code>sdist</code>).</dd>
							<dt><code>finalize_msi</code> (Windows only)</dt>
								<dd>Adds icons and start menu shortcuts to the MSI installer previously created with <code>bdist_msi</code>. Successful MSI creation needs a <a href="http://bugs.python.org/file15898/msilib_make_short.diff">patched msilib</a> (<a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue1128">additional</a> <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue7639">information</a>).</dd>
							<dt><code>inno</code> (Windows only)</dt>
								<dd>Creates an Inno Setup install script for an executable created with the <code>py2exe</code> or <code>bdist_standalone</code> commands.</dd>
							<dt><code>purge</code></dt>
								<dd>Removes the <code>build</code> and <code>dispcalGUI.egg-info</code> directories including their contents.</dd>
							<dt><code>purge_dist</code></dt>
								<dd>Removes the <code>dist</code> directory and its contents.</dd>
							<dt><code>readme</code></dt>
								<dd>Creates README.html by parsing misc/README.template.html and substituting placeholders like date and version numbers.</dd>
							<dt><code>uninstall</code></dt>
								<dd>Uninstalls the package. You can specify the same options as for the <code>install</code> command.</dd>
						</dl>
					</div>

					<h4>Additional setup options</h4>
					<div class="info">
						<dl>
							<dt><code>--cfg=&lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
								<dd>Use an alternate setup.cfg, e.g. tailored for a given Linux distribution. The original setup.cfg is backed up and restored afterwards. The alternate file must exist as misc/setup.&lt;name&gt;.cfg</dd>
							<dt><code>-n</code>, <code>--dry-run</code></dt>
								<dd>Don't actually do anything. Useful in combination with the uninstall command to see which files would be removed.</dd>
							<dt><code>--skip-instrument-configuration-files</code></dt>
								<dd>Skip installation of udev rules and hotplug scripts.</dd>
							<dt><code>--skip-postinstall</code></dt>
								<dd>Skip post-installation on Linux (an entry in the desktop menu will still be created, but may not become visible until logging out and back in or rebooting) and Windows (no shortcuts in the start menu will be created at all).</dd>
							<dt><code>--use-distutils</code></dt>
								<dd>Force setup to use distutils (default) instead of setuptools. This is useful in combination with the bdist* commands, because it will avoid an artificial dependency on setuptools. This is actually a switch, use it once and the choice is remembered until you specify the <code>--use-setuptools</code> switch (see next paragraph).</dd>
							<dt><code>--use-setuptools</code></dt>

			<h2>Basic concept of display calibration and profiling</h2>

			<p>If you have previous experience, <a href="#widegamut">skip ahead</a>. If you are new to display 
			calibration, here is a quick outline of the basic concept.</p>

			<p>First, the display behavior is measured and adjusted to meet 
			user-definable target characteristics, like brightness, gamma and white point. 
			This step is generally referred to as <em>calibration</em>. Calibration is done by 
			adjusting the monitor controls, and the output of the graphics card (via 
			<em>calibration curves</em>, also sometimes called <em>video <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> curves</em>—please don't confuse these with <em>LUT profiles</em>, the <a href="#difference_lutcurves_lutprofile" title="Difference between LUT (calibration) curves and LUT profiles">differences are explained here</a>) to get as 
			close as possible to the chosen target.<br />
			To meet the user-defined target characteristics, it is generally advisable to 
			get as far as possible by using the monitor controls, and only thereafter by 
			manipulating the output of the video card via calibration curves, which are loaded into the <em>video card gamma table</em>, to get the best
			results.</p>

			<p>Second, the calibrated displays response is measured and an <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></acronym> profile 
			describing it is created.</p>

			<p>Optionally and for convenience purposes, the calibration is stored in the profile, but both 
			still need to be used together to get correct results. This can lead to some ambiguity, 
			because loading the calibration curves from the profile is generally the 
			responsibility of a third party utility or the OS, while applications using 
			the profile to do color transforms usually rely on the calibration being already 
			loaded. Currently, the only OS that 
			applies calibration curves out-of-the-box is Mac OS X (under <a href="#issue-win7-autoloadcalibration">Windows 7 you can enable it</a>, but it's off by default)—for other OS's, dispcalGUI takes care of creating an appropriate loader.</p>

			<p>Even non-color-managed applications will benefit from a loaded 
			calibration because it is stored in the graphics card—it is “global”. But the calibration alone will not yield accurate colors—only fully color-managed applications will make use of display 
			profiles and the necessary color transforms.</p>

			<p>Regrettably there are several image viewing and editing applications that 
			only implement half-baked color management by not using the system's display profile (or any display profile at all), but an internal and often unchangeable “default”
			color space like sRGB, and sending output unaltered to the display after converting to that default colorspace. If the 
			display's actual response is close to sRGB, you might get pleasing (albeit not
			accurate) results, but on displays which behave differently, for example wide-color-gamut displays, even mundane colors can 
			get a strong tendency towards neon.</p>

			<h2>A note about colorimeters, wide-gamut displays and dispcalGUI</h2>

			<p>Colorimeters need a correction in hardware or software to obtain correct measurements from wide-gamut displays (please also see <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/WideGamutColmters.html">“Wide Gamut Displays and Colorimeters”</a> on the Argyll CMS website for more information). The latter is supported when using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.0, so if you own a wide-gamut display and colorimeter which has not been specifically tuned for this display (i.e. does not contain a correction in hardware), you can apply a correction that has been calculated from spectrometer measurements to help better measure such a screen.<br />
			You need a spectrometer in the first place to do the necessary measurements to create such a correction, or you may query dispcalGUI's <a href="http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/colorimetercorrections">Colorimeter Corrections Database</a>, and there's also a <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html">list of contributed colorimeter correction files on the Argyll CMS website</a>—<strong>please note</strong> though that a matrix created for one particular instrument/display combination may not work well for different instances of the same combination because of generally low inter-instrument agreement of most colorimeters.<br />
			Starting with dispcalGUI 0.6.8, you can also <a href="#import-correction-matrices">import generic corrections</a> from some profiling softwares by choosing the corresponding item in the “Tools” menu.</p>

			<p>If you buy a screen bundled with a colorimeter, the instrument may have been matched to the screen in some way already, so you may not need a software correction in that case.</p>

			<h3>Special note about the X-Rite i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4 colorimeters</h3>

			<p>These instruments greatly reduce the amount of work needed to match them to a display because they contain the spectral sensitivities of their filters in hardware, so only a spectrometer reading of the display is needed to create the correction (in contrast to matching other colorimeters to a display, which needs two readings: One with a spectrometer and one with the colorimeter).<br />
			That means anyone with a particular screen and a spectrometer can create a special <em>Calibration Spectral Sample</em> (<code>.ccss</code>) file of that screen for use with those colorimeters, without needing to actually have access to the colorimeter itself.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="usage">
			<h2>Usage</h2>

			<p>Through the main window, you can choose your settings. When running calibration measurements, another window will guide you through the interactive part of display adjustment.</p>

			<div id="settingsfile">
				<h3>Settings file</h3>
				<p>Here, you can load a calibration (<code>.cal</code>) or ICC profile (<code>.icc</code> / <code>.icm</code>) file from a previous 
				run. This will set options to 
				those stored in the file and also load
				calibration curves (if any) into the video card. If the file contains only a subset of settings, you will get a message showing which settings were loaded.</p>

				<p>If a calibration file or profile is loaded in this way, its name will
				show up here to indicate that the settings reflect those in the file.
				Also, if a calibration is present it can be used as the base when “Just Profiling”.<br />
				The chosen settings file will stay as long as you do not change any of the 
				calibration or profiling settings, with one exception: When a <code>.cal</code> file with the same base name as the settings file
				exists in the same directory, adjusting the quality and profiling controls will not cause unloading of the settings file. This allows you to use an existing calibration with new profiling settings for “Just Profiling”, or to update an existing calibration with different quality and/or profiling settings. If you change settings in other situations, the file will get unloaded (but current settings will be retained—unloading just happens to remind you that the settings no longer match those in the file), and current display profile's calibration curves will be restored (if present, otherwise they will reset to linear).</p>

				<p>When a calibration file is selected, the “Update calibration”
				checkbox will become available, which takes less time than a calibration from scratch.
				If a <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></acronym> profile is selected, and a calibration file with the same base name
				exists in the same directory, the profile will be updated with the new calibration. Ticking the “Update calibration” checkbox will gray out
				all options as well as the “Calibrate &amp; profile” and “Just profile” buttons, only the quality level will be changeable.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="presets">
				<h3>Predefined settings (presets)</h3>

				<p>Starting with dispcalGUI v0.2.5b, predefined settings for several use cases are selectable in the settings dropdown. I strongly recommend to NOT view these presets as the solitary “correct” settings you absolutely should use unmodified if your use case matches their description. Rather view them as starting points, from where you can work towards your own, optimized (in terms of your requirements, hardware, surroundings, and personal preference) settings.</p>

				<h4>Why has a default gamma of 2.2 been chosen for the presets?</h4>

				<p>Many displays, be it CRT or LCD type, have a default response characteristic close to a gamma of approx. 2.2-2.4 (for CRTs, this is the actual native behaviour; and LCDs typically try to mimic CRTs). A target response curve for calibration that is reasonably close to the native response of a display should help to minimize calibration artifacts like banding, because the adjustments needed to the video card's gamma tables via calibration curves will not be as strong as if a target response farther away from the display's native response had been chosen.</p>
				<p>Of course, you can and should change the calibration response curve to a value suitable for your own requirements. For example, you might have a display that offers hardware calibration or gamma controls, that has been internally calibrated/adjusted to a different response curve, or your display's response is simply not close to a gamma of 2.2 for other reasons. You can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure the approximated overall gamma among other info.</p>

				<h3>Choosing the display to calibrate and the measurement device</h3>

				<p>After connecting the instrument, click the small icon with the swirling arrows <img src="theme/refresh_lr.png" alt="" /> in between the “Display device” and “Instrument” controls to detect connected displays devices and instruments.</p>
				
				<h4 id="settings_measurement_modes">Choosing a measurement mode</h4>
				
				<p>Some instruments may support different measurement modes for different types of display devices. In general, there are three base measurement modes: “LCD”, “Refresh” (e.g. CRT and Plasma are refresh-type displays) and “Projector” (the latter is only available if supported by the instrument). Some instruments like the Spyder 4 and ColorHug support additional measurement modes, where a mode is coupled with a predefined colorimeter correction (in that case, you should set the <a href="#settings_colorimeter_correction">colorimeter correction</a> dropdown to “None” / “Off”).<br />
				Variations of these measurement modes may be available depending on the instrument: “Adaptive” measurement mode for spectrometers uses varying integration times to increase accuracy of dark readings, but may be more inconsistent overall. “HiRes” turns on high resolution spectral mode for spectrometers like the i1 Pro, which may increase the accuracy of measurements.</p>

				<h4 id="settings_drift_compensation">Drift compensation during measurements (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.0)</h4>
				
				<p>White level drift compensation tries to counter luminance changes of a warming up display device. For this purpose, a white test patch is measured periodically, which increases the overall time needed for measurements.</p>

				<p>Black level drift compensation tries to counter measurement deviations caused by black calibration drift of a warming up measurement device. For this purpose, a black test patch is measured periodically, which increases the overall time needed for measurements. Many colorimeters are temperature stabilised, in which case black level drift compensation should not be needed, but spectrometers like the i1 Pro or ColorMunki Design/Photo are not temperature compensated.</p>

				<h4 id="settings_colorimeter_correction">Choosing a colorimeter correction for a particular (wide-gamut) display</h4>

				<p>This can improve a colorimeters accuracy for a particular type of display, please also see <a href="#widegamut">“A note about colorimeters, wide-gamut displays and dispcalGUI”</a>. You can import generic matrices from some other display profiling softwares as well as check the online <a href="http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/colorimetercorrections/">Colorimeter Corrections Database</a> for a match of your display/instrument combination (click the small globe next to the correction dropdown). A <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html">list of contributed correction matrices</a> can also be found on the Argyll CMS website.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>Allows setting the target white point locus to the equivalent of a daylight or black body spectrum of the given temperature in degrees Kelvin, or as chromaticity co-ordinates. By default the white point target will be the native white of the display, and it's color temperature and delta E to the daylight spectrum locus will be shown during monitor adjustment, and adjustments will be recommended to put the display white point directly on the Daylight locus. If a daylight color temperature is given, then this will become the target of the adjustment, and the recommended adjustments will be those needed to make the monitor white point meet the target. Typical  values might be 5000 for matching printed output, or 6500, which gives a brighter, bluer look. A white point temperature different to that native to the display may limit the maximum brightness possible.</p>

							<p>If you want to find out the current uncalibrated whitepoint of your display, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure it.</p>

							<p>If you want to adjust the whitepoint to the chromaticities of your ambient lighting, or those of a viewing booth as used in prepress and photography, and your measurement device has ambient measuring capability (e.g. like the i1 Pro or i1 Display with their respective ambient measurement heads), you can use the “Measure” button next to the whitepoint settings. If you want to measure ambient lighting, place the instrument upwards, beside the display. Or if you want to measure a viewing booth, put a metamerism-free gray card inside the booth and point the instrument towards it. Further instructions how to measure ambient may be available in your instrument's documentation.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_white_level">White level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the target brightness of white in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. If this number cannot be reached, the brightest output possible is chosen, consistent with matching the white point target. Note that many of the instruments are not particularly accurate when assessing the absolute display brightness in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. NOTE that some LCD screens behave a little strangely near their absolute white point, and may therefore exhibit odd behavior at values just below white. It may be advisable in such cases to set a brightness slightly less than the maximum such a display is capable of.</p>

							<p>If you want to find out the current uncalibrated white level of your display, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure it.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_level">Black level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Can be used to set the target brightness of black in cd/m<sup>2</sup> and is useful for e.g. matching two different screens with different native blacks to one another, by measuring the black levels on both (i.e. in the “Tools” menu, choose “Report on uncalibrated display”) and then entering the highest measured value. Normally you may want to use native black level though, to maximize contrast ratio. Setting too high a value may also give strange results as it interacts with trying to achieve the target “advertised” tone curve shape. Using a black output offset of 100% tries to minimize such problems.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="trc">Tone curve / gamma</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>The target response curve is normally an exponential curve (output = input<sup>gamma</sup>), and defaults to 2.2 (which is close to a typical CRT displays real response). Four pre-defined curves can be used as well: the sRGB colorspace response curve, which is an exponent curve with a straight segment at the dark end and an overall response of approximately gamma 2.2, the L* curve, which is the response of the CIE L*a*b* perceptual colorspace, the Rec. 709 video standard response curve and the SMPTE 240M video standard response curve.</p>

							<p>Note that a real display can't reproduce any of these ideal curves, since it will have a non-zero black point, whereas all the ideal curves assume zero light at zero input.</p>

							<p>For gamma values, you can also specify wheter it should be interpreted relative, meaning the gamma value provided is used to set an actual response curve in light of the non-zero black of the actual display that has the same relative output at 50% input as the ideal gamma power curve, or absolute, which allows the actual power to be specified instead, meaning that after the actual displays non-zero black is accounted for, the response at 50% input will probably not match that of the ideal power curve with that gamma value (to see this setting, you have to go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced calibration options”).</p>

							<p>To allow for the non-zero black level of a real display, by default the target curve values will be offset so that zero input gives the actual black level of the display (output offset). This ensures that the target curve better corresponds to the typical natural behavior of displays, but it may not be the most visually even progression from display minimum. This behavior can be changed using the black output offset option (see further below).</p>

							<p>Also note that many color spaces are encoded with, and labelled as having a gamma of approximately 2.2 (ie. sRGB, REC 709, SMPTE 240M, Macintosh OS X 10.6), but are actually intended to be displayed on a display with a typical CRT gamma of 2.4 viewed in a darkened environment.<br />
							This is because this 2.2 gamma is a source gamma encoding in bright viewing conditions such as a television studio, while typical display viewing conditions are quite dark by comparison, and a contrast expansion of (approx.) gamma 1.1 is desirable to make the images look as intended.<br />
							So if you are displaying images encoded to the sRGB standard, or displaying video through the calibration, just setting the gamma curve to sRGB or REC 709 (respectively) is probably not what you want! What you probably want to do, is to set the gamma curve to about gamma 2.4, so that the contrast range is expanded appropriately, or alternatively use sRGB or REC 709 or a gamma of 2.2 but also specify the actual ambient viewing conditions via a light level in Lux, so that an appropriate contrast enhancement can be made during calibration. If your instrument is capable of measuring ambient light levels, then you can do so.<br />
							<span class="footnote">(For in-depth technical information about sRGB, see “<a href="http://www.color.org/sRGB.xalter">A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet: sRGB</a>” at the <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></acronym> website for details of how it is intended to be used)</span></p>

							<p>If you're wondering what gamma value you should use, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure the approximated overall gamma among other info. Setting the gamma to the reported value can then help to reduce calibration artifacts like banding, because the adjustments needed for the video card's gamma table should not be as strong as if a gamma further away from the display's native response was chosen.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="ambient">Ambient light level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced calibration options”)</p>

							<p>As explained for the tone curve settings, often colors are encoded in a situation with viewing conditions that are quite different to the viewing conditions of a typical display, with the expectation that this difference in viewing conditions will be allowed for in the way the display is calibrated. The ambient light level option is a way of doing this. By default calibration will not make any allowances for viewing conditions, but will calibrate to the specified response curve, but if the ambient light level is entered or measured (which you may also do during the interactive display controls portion of the calibration), an appropriate viewing conditions adjustment will be performed. For a gamma value or sRGB, the original viewing conditions will be assumed to be that of the sRGB standard viewing conditions, while for REC 709 and SMPTE 240M they will be assumed to be television studio viewing conditions.<br />
							By specifying or measuring the ambient lighting for your display, a viewing conditions adjustment based on the CIECAM02 color appearance model will be made for the brightness of your display and the contrast it makes with your ambient light levels.</p>

							<p>Please note your measurement device needs ambient measuring capability (e.g. like the i1 Pro or i1 Display 2 with their respective ambient measurement heads) to measure the ambient light level.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_output_offset">Black output offset</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced calibration options”)</p>

							<p>Real displays do not have a zero black response, while all the target response curves do, so this has to be allowed for in some way.</p>

							<p>The default way of handling this (equivalent to 100% black output offset) is to allow for this at the output of the ideal response curve, by offsetting and scaling the output values. This defined a curve that will match the responses that many other systems provide and may be a better match to the natural response of the display, but will give a less visually even response from black.</p>

							<p>The other alternative is to offset and scale the input values into the ideal response curve so that zero input gives the actual non-zero display response. This ensures the most visually even progression from display minimum, but might be hard to achieve since it is different to the natural response of a display.</p>

							<p>A subtlety is to provide a split between how much of the offset is accounted for as input to the ideal response curve, and how much is accounted for at the output, where the degree is 0.0 accounts for it all as input offset, and 100% accounts for all of it as output offset.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_point_correction">Black point correction</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced calibration options”)</p>

							<p>Normally dispcal will attempt to make all colors down the neutral axis (R=G=B) have the same hue as the chosen white point. Near the black point, red, green or blue can only be added, not subtracted from zero, so the process of making the near black colors have the desired hue, will lighten them to some extent. For a device with a good contrast ratio or a black point that has nearly the same hue as the white, this is not a problem. If the device contrast ratio is not so good, and the black hue is noticeably different to that of the chosen white point (which is often the case for LCD type displays), this could have a noticeably detrimental effect on an already limited contrast ratio. Here the amount of black point hue correction can be controlled.<br />
							By default a factor of 100% will be used, which is usually good for CRT and also by default a factor of 0% is used for LCD type displays, but you can override these with a custom value between 0% (no correction) to 100% (full correction).</p>

							<p>If less than full correction is chosen, then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then cross over to the native or compromise black point.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_point_correction_rate">Black point correction rate (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.0.4)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced calibration options”)</p>

							<p>If the black point is not being set completely to the same hue as the white point (ie. because the factor is less than 100%), then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then blend over to the native or compromise black point that is blacker, but not of the right hue. The rate of this blend can be controlled. The default value is 4.0, which results in a target that switches from the white point target to the black, moderately close to the black point. While this typically gives a good visual result with the target neutral hue being maintained to the point where the crossover to the black hue is not visible, it may be asking too much of some displays (typically LCD type displays), and there may be some visual effects due to inconsistent color with viewing angle. For this situation a smaller value may give a better visual result (e.g. try values of 3.0 or 2.0. A value of 1.0 will set a pure linear blend from white point to black point). If there is too much coloration near black, try a larger value, e.g. 6.0 or 8.0.</p>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_quality">Calibration speed</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>Determines how much time and effort to go to in calibrating the display. The lower the speed, the more test readings will be done, the more refinement passes will be done, the tighter will be the accuracy tolerance, and the more detailed will be the calibration of the display. The result will ultimately be limited by the accuracy of the instrument, the repeatability of the display and instrument, and the resolution of the video card gamma table entries and digital or analogue output (RAMDAC).</p>

					<dt id="testchart_file">Testchart file</dt>
						<dd>You can choose the test patches used when profiling the display here. The default ones are automatically chosen based on profile quality and type, but you can also use and create your own using the built-in testchart editor (click on the colored patches next to the testchart file selector or choose “Edit testchart...” from the “File” menu to launch it).</dd>

					<dt id="testchart_editor">Testchart editor</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The provided default testcharts should work well in most situations, but allowing you to create custom charts ensures maximum flexibility when characterizing a display and can improve profiling accuracy and efficiency. See also <a href="#optimizecharts">optimizing testcharts</a>.

							<p>You can enter the amount of patches to be generated for each patch type (white, gray, single channel, iterative and multidimensional cube steps). The iterative algorythm can be tuned if more than zero patches are to be generated. What follows is a quick description of the several available iterative algorythms, with “device space” meaning in this case RGB coordinates, and “perceptual space” meaning the (assumed) XYZ numbers of those RGB coordinates. The assumed XYZ numbers can be influenced by providing a previous profile, thus allowing optimized test point placement.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Optimized Farthest Point Sampling (OFPS) will optimize the point locations to minimize the distance from any point in device space to the nearest sample point</li>
								<li>Incremental Far Point Distribution incrementally searches for test points that are as far away as possible from any existing points</li>
								<li>Device space random chooses test points with an even random distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space random chooses test points with an even random distribution in perceptual space</li>
								<li>Device space filling quasi-random chooses test points with a quasi-random, space filling distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space filling quasi-random chooses test points with a quasi-random, space filling distribution in perceptual space</li>
								<li>Device space body centered cubic grid chooses test points with body centered cubic distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space body centered cubic grid chooses test points with body centered cubic distribution in perceptual space</li>
							</ul>

							<p>You can set the degree of adaptation to the known device characteristics used by the default full spread OFPS algorithm. A preconditioning profile should be provided if adaptation is set above a low level. By default the adaptation is 10% (low), and should be set to 100% (maximum) if a profile is provided. But, if for instance, the preconditioning profile doesn't represent the device behavior very well, a lower adaption than 100% might be appropriate.</p>

							<p>For the body centered grid distributions, the angle parameter sets the overall angle that the grid distribution has.</p>

							<p>The “Limit samples to sphere” option is used to define an L*a*b* sphere to filter the test points through. Only test points within the sphere (defined by it's center and radius) will be in the generated testchart. This can be good for targeting supplemental test points at a troublesome area of a device. The accuracy of the L*a*b* target will be best when a reasonably accurate preconditioning profile for the device is chosen. Note that the actual number of points generated can be hard to predict, and will depend on the type of generation used. If the OFPS, device and perceptual space random and device space filling quasi-random methods are used, then the target number of points will be achieved. All other means of generating points will generate a smaller number of test points than expected. For this reason, the device space filling quasi-random method is probably the easiest to use.</p>

							<p>Controls for the spreadsheet-like patch editor are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To select patches, click and drag the mouse over table cells, or hold SHIFT (select range) or CTRL/CMD (add/remove single cells/rows to/from selection)</li>
								<li>To add a patch below an existing one, double-click a row label</li>
								<li>To delete patches, select them, then hold CTRL (Linux, Windows) or CMD (Mac OS X) and hit DEL or BACKSPACE (will always delete whole rows even if only single cells are selected)</li>
								<li>CTRL-C/CTRL-V/CTRL-A = copy/paste/select all</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you want to insert a certain amount of patches generated in a spreadsheet application (as RGB coordinates in the range 0.0-100.0 per channel), the easiest way to do this is probably to copy the values from the spreadsheet app, entering the testchart editor, generating a corresponding amount of patches and then overwriting them by doing CTRL-A, CTRL-V.</p>

Curves are more accurate than gamma values. A single curve or gamma can be used if individual curves or gamma values degrade the gray balance of an otherwise good calibration.</p>

							<p><acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> based profiles are larger in filesize, more accurate (but may sacrifice smoothness), in some cases less compatible (applications might not be able to use or show bugs/quirks with <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> type profiles, or certain variations of them).
							When choosing a <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> based profile type, advanced gamut mapping options become available which you can use to create perceptual and/or saturation tables inside the profile in addition to the default colorimetric tables which are always created.<br />
							L*a*b* or XYZ can be used as <acronym title="Profile Connection Space">PCS</acronym>, with XYZ being recommended especially for wide-gamut displays bacause their primaries might exceed the <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></acronym> L*a*b* encoding range (Note: Under Windows, XYZ <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> types are only available in dispcalGUI if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.1.0 because of a requirement for matrix tags in the profile, which are not created by prior Argyll CMS versions).<br />
							As it is hard to verify if the <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> of an combined XYZ <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> + matrix profile is actually used, you may choose to create a profile with a swapped matrix (which I'd recommend), ie. blue-red-green instead of red-green-blue, so it will be obvious if an application uses the (deliberately wrong) matrix instead of the (correct) LUT because the colors will look very wrong (e.g. everything that should be red will be blue, green will be red, blue will be green, yellow will be purple etc).</p>

							<p id="difference_lutcurves_lutprofile">Note: <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>-based profiles (which contain three-dimensional LUTs) might be confused with video card <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> (calibration) curves (one-dimensional LUTs), but they're two different things. Both <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>-based and matrix-based profiles may include calibration curves which can be loaded into a video card's gamma table hardware.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_profiling_gamutmapping">Advanced gamut mapping options</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Normally, profiles created by dispcalGUI only incorporate the colorimetric rendering intent, which means colors outside the display's gamut will be clipped to the next in-gamut color. LUT-type profiles can also have gamut mapping by implementing perceptual and/or saturation rendering intents. You can choose if and which of those you want after clicking “Advanced...”, by specifying a source profile and marking the appropriate checkboxes. Note that a input, output, display or device colororspace profile should be specified as source, not a non-device colorspace, device link, abstract or named color profile. You can also choose viewing conditions which describe the intended use of both the source and the display profile that is to be generated. An appropriate source viewing condition is chosen automatically based on the source profile type.</p>

							<p>For more information on why a source gamut is needed, see “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/iccgamutmapping.html">About ICC profiles and Gamut Mapping</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation.</p>

							<p>One strategy for getting the best perceptual results with display profiles is as follows: Select a CMYK profile as source for gamut mapping. Then, when converting from another RGB profile to the display profile, use relative colorimetric intent, and if converting from a CMYK profile, use the perceptual intent.<br />
							Another approach which especially helps limited-gamut displays is to choose one of the larger (gamut-wise) source profiles you usually work with for gamut mapping, and then always use perceptual intent when converting to the display profile.</p>

							<p>Please note that not all applications support setting a rendering intent for display profiles and might default to colorimetric (e.g. Photoshop normally uses relative colorimetric with black point compensation, but can use different intents via custom soft proofing settings).</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_profiling_bpc">Black point compensation</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This effectively prevents black crush when using the profile, but at the expense of accuracy. (Note: This option has no effect if just calibrating and creating a simple curves + matrix profile directly from the calibration data without additional profiling measurements)</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Profile name</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>As long as you do not enter your own text here, the profile name is auto generated from the chosen calibration and profiling options. The current auto naming mechanism creates quite verbose names which are not necessarily nice to read, but they can help in identifying the profile.<br />
							Also note that the profile name is not only used for the resulting profile, but for all intermediate files as well (filename extensions are added automatically) <em>and</em> all files are stored in a folder of that name. You can choose where this folder is created by clicking the disk icon next to the field (it defaults to your system's default location for user data).</p>

							<p>Here's an example under Linux, on other platforms some file extensions and the location of the home directory will differ (you can mouse over the filenames to get a tooltip with a short description what the file is for):</p>

							<p>Chosen profile save path: <samp title="User home directory">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage</samp></p>

							<p>Profile name: <samp>mydisplay</samp></p>

							<p>The following folder will be created: <samp>~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay</samp></p>

							<p>During calibration &amp; profiling the following files will be created:</p>

				<h3>Calibrating / profiling</h3>

				<p>If you are unclear about the difference between calibration and profiling (also called characterisation), see “<a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/calvschar.html">Calibration vs. Characterization</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation.</p>

				<p>Please let the screen stabilize for at least half an hour after powering it up before doing any measurements or assessing its color properties. The screen can be used normally with other applications during that time.</p>

				<p>After you have set your options, click on one of the three buttons at the bottom
				to start the actual calibration/profiling process. The main window will hide during measurements, and should pop up again after they are completed (or after an 
				error). You can always cancel out of running measurements using the “Cancel” button in the progress dialog, or by pressing ESC or Q. Viewing the informational log window (from the “Tools” menu) after measurements will give you access to the raw output of the Argyll CMS commandline tools and other verbose information.</p>

				<h4 id="adjusting">Adjusting a display before calibration</h4>

				<p>If you clicked “Calibrate” or “Calibrate &amp; profile” and have not turned off “Interactive display adjustment”, you will be presented with the interactive display adjustment window which contains several options to help you bring a display's characteristics closer to the chosen target values. Depending on wheter you have a CRT- or LCD-type display, I will try to give some recommendations here which options to adjust, and which to skip.</p>

				<h5>Adjusting a LCD display</h5>

				<p>For LCD displays, you will in most cases only want to adjust white point (if the screen has RGB gain or other whitepoint controls) and white level (with the white level also affecting the black level unless you have a local dimming LED model), as many LCDs lack the necessary “offset” controls to adjust the black point (and even if they happen to have them, they often change the overall color temperature, not only the black point). Also note that for most LCD screens, you should leave the “contrast” control at (factory) default.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>White point</dt>
						<dd>
							If your screen has RGB gain, colortemperature or other whitepoint controls, the first step should be adjusting the whitepoint. Note that you may also benefit from this adjustment if you have set the target whitepoint to “native”, as it will allow you to bring it closer to the daylight or blackbody locus, which can help the human visual system to better adapt to the whitepoint. Look at the bars shown during the measurements to adjust RGB gains and minimize the delta E to the target whitepoint.
						</dd>
					<dt>White level</dt>
						<dd>
							Continue with the white level adjustment. If you have set a target white level, you may reduce or increase the brightness of your screen (ideally using only the backlight) until the desired value is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position). If you haven't set a target, simply adjust the screen to a visually pleasing brightness that doesn't cause eye strain.
						</dd>
				</dl>

				<h5>Adjusting a CRT display</h5>

				<dl>
					<dt>Black level</dt>
						<dd>
							On CRTs, this adjustment is done using the “brightness” control. You may reduce or increase the brightness of your screen until the desired black level is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position).
						</dd>
					<dt>White point</dt>
						<dd>
							The next step should be adjusting the whitepoint, using the display's RGB gain controls or other means of adjusting the whitepoint. Note that you may also benefit from this adjustment if you have set the target whitepoint to “native”, as it will allow you to bring it closer to the daylight or blackbody locus, which can help the human visual system to better adapt to the whitepoint. Look at the bars shown during the measurements to adjust RGB gains and minimize the delta E to the target whitepoint.
						</dd>
					<dt>White level</dt>
						<dd>
							Continue with the white level adjustment. On CRTs this is done using the “contrast” control. If you have set a target white level, you may reduce or increase contrast until the desired value is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position). If you haven't set a target, simply adjust the screen to a visually pleasing level that doesn't cause eye strain.
						</dd>
					<dt>Black point</dt>
						<dd>
							If your display has RGB offset controls, you can adjust the black point as well, in much the same way that you adjusted the whitepoint.
						</dd>
				</dl>

				<h5>Finishing adjustments (CRT/LCD) and starting calibration/characterisation</h5>

				<p>After the adjustments, you can run a check on all the settings by choosing the last option from the left-hand menu to verify the achieved values. If adjusting one setting adversely affected another, you can then simply repeat the respective option as necessary until the target parameters are met.</p>

				<p>Finally, select “Continue on to calibration” to start the non-interactive part. You may want to get a coffee or two as the process can take a fair amount of time, especially if you selected a high quality level. If you only wanted help to adjust the display and don't want/need calibration curves to be created, you can also choose to exit by closing the interactive display adjustment window and then select “Profile only” from the main window.<br />
				If you originally selected “Calibrate &amp; profile” and fulfil the requirements for <a href="#requirements-unattended">unattended calibration &amp; profiling</a>, the characterisation measurements for the profiling process should start automatically after calibration is finished. Otherwise, you may be forced to take the instrument off the screen to do a sensor self-calibration before starting the profiling measurements.</p>
				
				<h5 id="optimizecharts">Optimizing testcharts for improved profiling accuracy and efficiency</h5>
				
				<p>A good way to generate a custom testchart to improve profiling is to use one of the default testcharts as base, altering the parameters as necessary and desired. Especially the use of an existing display profile to precondition generated test patches for improved profiling performance is recommended. You could go about this in the following way:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>When calibrating, choose “just calibrate” and the option to create a fast curves + matrix profile.</li>
					<li>After calibration, select a testchart to use as base (preferably one of the optimized ones) and bring up the testchart editor.</li>
					<li>Place a check in the “preconditioning profile” checkbox and click on “current profile”. It should automatically select the curves + matrix profile that was created during calibration. Make sure adaptation is set to a high level (e.g. 100%)</li>
					<li>If desired, adjust the number of patches and make sure the iterative patches amount is not zero.</li>
					<li>Create the chart and save it. Click “yes” when asked to select the newly generated chart.</li>
					<li>Start the profiling measurements (e.g. click “profile only”).</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Profile installation</h4>

				<p>When installing a profile after creating or updating it, a startup item to load its calibration curves 
				automatically on login will be created (on Windows and Linux, Mac OS X does not need a loader). You may also prevent this loader from doing anything by removing the check in the “Load calibration curves on Login” checkbox in the profile installation dialog, and in case you are using Windows 7 or later, you may let the operating system handle calibration loading instead (to be able to change this option, you need to run dispcalGUI as administrator).</p>
				
				<h3>Advanced functions</h3>
				
				<h4 id="remote">Remote measurements and profiling</h4>
				
				<p>When using Argyll CMS 1.4.0 and newer, remote measurements on a device not directly connected to the machine that is running dispcalGUI is possible (e.g. a smartphone or tablet). The remote device needs to be able to run a web browser (Firefox recommended), and the local machine running dispcalGUI may need firewall rules added or altered to allow incoming connections. To set up remote profiling, select “Web @ localhost” from the display device dropdown menu, then choose the desired action (e.g. “Profile only”). When the message “Webserver waiting at http://&lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;” appears, open the shown address in the remote browser and attach the measurement device.<br />
				<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use this method of displaying test patches, there is no access to the display video <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>s and hardware calibration is not possible. The colors will be displayed with 8 bit per component precision, and any screen-saver or power-saver will not be automatically disabled. You will also be at the mercy of any color management applied by the web browser, and may have to carefully review and configure such color management.<br />
				<strong>NOTE:</strong> Close the web browser window or tab after each run, otherwise reconnection may fail upon further runs.</p>
				
				<h4 id="untethered">Untethered display measurements</h4>
				
				<p>Untethered mode is another option to measure and profile a remote display that is not connected via standard means (calibration is not supported). To use untethered mode, the testchart that should be used needs to be optimized, then exported as image files (via the testchart editor) and those image files need to be displayed on the device that should be measured, in successive order. The procedure is as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select the desired testchart, then open the testchart editor.</li>
					<li>Click “Optimize for untethered in auto mode”, then export the testchart.</li>
					<li>Burn the images to a DVD, copy them on an USB stick or use any other available means to get them to display onto the device that should be measured.</li>
					<li>In dispcalGUI's display dropdown, select “Untethered” (the last option).</li>
					<li>Show the first image on the remote display, and attach the instrument. Then select “Profile only”.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Measurements will commence, and changes in the displayed image should be automatically detected if “auto” mode is enabled. Use whatever means available to you to cycle through the images from first to last, carefully monitoring the measurement process and only changing to the next image if the current one has been successfully measured (as will be shown in the untethered measurement window). Note that untethered mode will be (atleast) twice as slow as normal display measurements.</p>

					<dt id="verify-cal">Verify calibration</dt>
						<dd>Run verify measurements on the selected display as it is currently setup (ie. video card gamma table). This will use the usual input parameters to establish the expected (target) characteristic.

					<dt id="verify-profile">Verify profile</dt>
						<dd><p>Do verification measurements to assess the display chain's (display profile - video card and the calibration curves in its gamma table - monitor) fit to the measured data, or to find out about the soft proofing capabilities of the display chain.</p>

						<p>To do the former, you have to select a <acronym title="CGATS.5 Data Exchange Format">CGATS<sup><a href="#definition_CGATS">[1]</a></sup></acronym> testchart file containing device values (RGB). The measured values are then compared to the values obtained by feeding the device RGB numbers through the display profile (measured vs expected values). The default verification chart contains 24 patches and can be used, for example, to check if a display needs to be re-profiled. If a RGB testchart with gray patches (R=G=B) is measured, like the default and extended verification charts, you also have the option to evaluate the graybalance through the calibration only, by placing a check in the corresponding box on the report.</p>

						<p>To perform a check on the soft proofing capabilities, you have to provide a CGATS reference file containing XYZ or L*a*b* data, or a combination of simulation profile and testchart file (in the latter case, first choose the simulation profile, and afterwards the testchart itself), which will be fed through the display profile to lookup corresponding device (RGB) values, and then be sent to the display and measured. Afterwards, the measured values are compared to the original XYZ or L*a*b* values, which can give a hint how suitable (or unsuitable) the display is for softproofing to the colorspace indicated by the reference.</p>

						<p>The display profile that is used for verification is the one currently selected under “Settings”, or the current display profile if any. Otherwise, a file dialog will appear to allow choosing a profile. The report files generated after the verification measurements are plain HTML with some embedded JavaScript, and are fully self-contained. They also contain the reference and measurement data, which consists of device RGB numbers, original measured XYZ values, and D50-adapted L*a*b* values computed from the XYZ numbers, and which can be examined as plain text directly from the report at the click of a button.</p>

						<h4>How were the nominal and recommended aim values chosen?</h4>

						<p>The nominal tolerances, with the whitepoint, average, maximum and gray balance Delta E CIE 1976 aim values stemming from <a href="http://www.fogra.org/mediawedge/">UGRA/Fogra Media Wedge</a> and <a href="http://www.ugra.ch/ugra-display-analysis-and-certification-tool.phtml">UDACT</a>, are pretty generous, so I've included somewhat stricter “recommended” numbers which I've chosen more or less arbitrarily to provide a bit “extra safety margin”.</p>

						<p>For reports generated from reference files that contain CMYK numbers in addition to L*a*b* or XYZ values, you can also select the official Fogra Media Wedge V3 or IDEAlliance Control Strip aim values for paper white, CMYK solids and CMY grey, if the chart contains the right CMYK combinations.</p>

						<h4>How are the results of the profile verification report to be interpreted?</h4>

						<p>This depends on the chart that was measured. The explanation in the first paragraph sums it up pretty well: If you have calibrated and profiled your display, and want to check how well the profile fits a set of measurements (profile accuracy), or if you want to know if your display has drifted and needs to be re-calibrated/re-profiled, you select a chart containing RGB numbers for the verification. Note that directly after profiling, accuracy can be expected to be high if the profile characterizes the display well, which will usually be the case if the display behaviour is not very non-linear, in which case creating a LUT profile instead of a “Curves + matrix” one, or increasing the number of measured patches for LUT profiles, can help.</p>

						<p>If you want to know how well your profile can simulate another colorspace (softproofing), select a reference file containing L*a*b* or XYZ values, like one of the <a href="http://www.fogra.org/mediawedge/">Fogra Media Wedge</a> subsets, or a combination of a simulation profile and testchart (in the latter case, first choose the simulation profile, and afterwards the testchart itself). Be warned though, only wide-gamut displays will handle a larger offset printing colorspace like FOGRA39 or similar well enough.</p>

						<p>In both cases, you should check that atleast the nominal tolerances are not exceeded. For a bit “extra safety margin”, look at the recommended values instead.</p>

						<p>Note that both tests are “closed-loop” and will not tell you an “absolute” truth in terms of “color quality” or “color accuracy” as they may not show if your instrument is faulty/measures wrong (a profile created from repeatable wrong measurements will usually still verify well against other wrong measurements from the same instrument if they don't fluctuate too much) or does not cope with your display well (which is especially true for <a href="#widegamut">colorimeters and wide-gamut screens</a>, as such combinations need a <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html" title="List of contributed colorimeter correction files on the Argyll CMS website">correction</a> in hardware or software to obtain accurate results—this problem does not exist with spectrometers, which do not need a correction for wide-gamut, but have lately been discovered to have issues measuring the correct brightness of some LED backlit displays which use white LEDs), or if colors on your screen match an actual colored object next to it (like a print). It is perfectly possible to obtain good verification results but the actual visual performance being sub-par. It is always wise to combine such measurements with a test of the actual visual appearance via a “known good” reference, like a print or proof (although it should not be forgotten that those also have tolerances, and illumination also plays a big role when assessing visual results). Keep all that in mind when admiring (or pulling your hair out over) verification results :)</p>

						<h4>How are profiles evaluated against the measured values?</h4>

						<p>Different softwares use different methods (which are not always disclosed in detail) to compare and evaluate measurements. This section aims to give interested users a better insight how dispcalGUI's profile verification feature works “under the hood”.</p>

						<h5>How is a testchart or reference file used?</h5>

						<p>There are currently two slightly different paths depending if a testchart or reference file is used for the verification measurements, as outlined above. In both cases, Argyll's <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/xicclu.html">xicclu</a> utility is run behind the scenes and the values of the testchart or reference file are fed relative colorimetrically through the profile that is tested to obtain corresponding L*a*b* (in the case of RGB testcharts) or device RGB numbers (in the case of XYZ or L*a*b* reference files or a combination of simulation profile and testchart). If a combination of simulation profile and testchart is used as reference, the reference L*a*b* values are calculated by feeding the device numbers from the testchart through the simulation profile absolute colorimetrically if the simulation profile is a printer profile and relative colorimetrically if it is a display profile (like most RGB working spaces). Then, the original RGB values from the testchart, or the looked up RGB values for a reference are sent to the display through the calibration curves of the profile that is going to be evaluated (actually the calibration curves are loaded before the RGB numbers are sent to the display for measurement with <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/dispread.html">dispread</a>). A reference white of D50 (ICC default) and complete chromatic adaption of the viewer to the display's whitepoint is always assumed, so the measured XYZ values are adapted to D50 (with the measured whitepoint as source reference white) using the Bradford transform (see <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html">Chromatic Adaption</a> on <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/">Bruce Lindbloom's website</a> for the formula and matrix that is used by dispcalGUI) or with the adaption matrix from the profile in the case of profiles with 'chad' chromatic adaption tag, and converted to L*a*b*. The L*a*b* values are then compared by the generated dynamic report, with user-selectable critera and ΔE (delta E) formula.</p>

						<h5>How is the assumed vs. measured whitepoint ΔE calculated?</h5>

						<p>In a report, the correlated color temperature and assumed target whitepoint, as well as the whitepoint ΔE, do warrant some further explanations: The whitepoint ΔE is calculated as difference between the measured whitepoint's and the assumed target whitepoint's normalized XYZ values, which are first converted to L*a*b*. The assumed target whitepoint color temperature shown is simply the rounded correlated color temparature (100K threshold) calculated from the measured XYZ values. The XYZ values for the assumed target whitepoint are obtained by calculating the chromaticity (xy) coordinates of a CIE D (daylight) or blackbody illuminant of that color temperature and converting them to XYZ. You can find all the used formulas on <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/">Bruce Lindbloom's website</a> and on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planckian_locus#Approximation">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

						<h5>How is the gray balance “range” evaluated?</h5>

						<p>The gray balance “range” uses a combined delta a/delta b absolute deviation (e.g. if max delta a = -0.5 and max delta b = 0.7, the range is 1.2). Because results in the extreme darks can be problematic due to lack of instrument accuracy and other effects like a black point which has a different chromaticity than the whitepoint, all gray balance checks in dispcalGUI only take into account gray patches with a minimum measured luminance of 1% (i.e. if the white luminance = 120 cd/m², then only patches with at least 1.2 cd/m² will be taken into account).</p>

						<h5>What does the “Evaluate gray balance through calibration only” checkbox on a report actually do?</h5>

						<p>It sets the nominal (target) L* value to the measured L* value and a*=b*=0, so the profile is effectively ignored and only the calibration (if any) will influence the results of the gray balance checks. Note that this option will not make a difference for a “Single curve + matrix” profile, as the single curve effectively already achieves a similar thing (the L* values can be different, but they are ignored for the gray balance checks and only influence the overall result).</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Update profile verification report...</dt>
						<dd>This allows to update an existing report HTML file with the template and functionality from a newer version of dispcalGUI (no measurements involved). It's a handy way to get new or changed comparison features, updated layout and even bugfixes into old reports. A backup copy of the old report with a date extension will automatically be created.</dd>

					<dt>Measure display device uniformity...</dt>
						<dd>Measure the display at several points to evaluate evenness of illumination and chroma errors. The results are shown after all patches are measured, and include the luminance difference, delta C, which is the chrominance difference, CCT (correlated color temperature), and CDT (closest daylight temperature) or CPT (closest planckian temperature) depending on the selection for the whitepoint locus in the main window. Differences are computed in comparison to the center point, which is used as reference.</dd>


					<dt id="import-correction-matrices">Import colorimeter corrections from other display profiling software...</dt>
						<dd>Converts matrices from other softwares to Argyll's CCMX / CCSS formats and adds them to the corresponding dropdown menu. Currently iColor Display, i1 Profiler, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4 softwares are supported. If they are installed or the CD / disk image is mounted, the correct file(s) can in most cases be imported automatically. Please note: The colorimeter corrections imported from Spyder 4 software are only usable with the Spyder 4 and need to be selected in the measurement mode dropdown instead of the colorimeter corrections dropdown.</dd>


					<dt id="create-colorimeter-correction">Create colorimeter correction...</dt>
						<dd>Allows you to create correction matrices for ordinary colorimeters as well as Calibration Spectral Sample files for i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4.
							Before you choose this menu option though, you must measure the special Colorimeter Correction testchart with a spectrometer and (in case you want to create an ordinary correction matrix) with the colorimeter. To do this, select the aforementioned chart in the testchart file dropdown, then select “Measure testchart” from the “Options” menu. After you have measured the chart(s), you can select the resulting measurement files for processing into a correction matrix or Calibration Spectral Sample file.

						<dd>The Spyder 2 instrument cannot function without the presence of the instrument vendors PLD firmware pattern for the device. This firmware is not provided with Argyll CMS nor dispcalGUI, since it has not been made available under a compatible license.<br />
The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument should have received a copy of this firmware along with their instrument from the original vendor, as part of the instrument setup files.<br />
On Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, if the vendors drivers have been installed on the users machine, the firmware pattern can usually be located from there. If the vendors drivers have not been installed, or the user does not wish to install them, or no vendors drivers are available for the users platform (i.e. Linux), then the Spyder 2 installation CDROM will also be searched if present. If your Linux system is not running automount, or your automount is setup to mount CDROM's somewhere other than /media, /mnt/cdrom, /media/cdrom or /cdrom, then you will have to mount the CDROM manually, and select the path to the CDROM setup/setup.exe file.

			<dl>
				<dt id="issue-redgreenswapped"><span>General:</span> Wacky image colors (swapped colors)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> This happens when you created a “XYZ LUT + swapped matrix” profile and is a way to alert you that the software you're using does not support XYZ LUT profiles and falls back to the included matrix (which generally means you'd loose accuracy). If you're having this situation only in some applications, creating a “XYZ LUT + matrix” profile will remedy it (but please keep in mind that those applications not supporting XYZ LUT will still fall back to the matrix, so results can be different from applications that support XYZ LUT correctly). If all colormanaged applications you use show swapped colors, you should create a matrix profile instead. Note that you do not have to re-run any measurements: In dispcalGUI, choose a profile type as suggested previously, adjust quality and profile name if you want, then choose “Create profile from measurement data...” in the “Options” menu and select the profile you had the issue with.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-samplereadfail"><span>General:</span> Measurements are failing (“Sample read failed”) if using the “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” option and/or highres/adaptive mode</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Disable either or all of the above options. The problem seems to mainly occur with the ColorMunki.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-process-startfail"><span>Windows:</span> “The process &lt;dispcal.exe|dispread.exe|...&gt; could not be started.”</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to your Argyll_VX.X.X\bin directory, and right-click the exe file from the error message. Select “Properties”, and then if there is a text on the “General” tab under security “This file came from another computer and might be blocked”, click “Unblock”.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-photoshop-monprofdefect"><span>Photoshop:</span> “The monitor profile […] appears to be defective. Please rerun your monitor calibration software.”</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Adobe ACE, Adobe's color conversion engine, contains monitor profile validation functionality which attempts to filter out bad profiles. With XYZ LUT profiles created in Argyll CMS versions up to 1.3.2, the B2A white point mapping is sometimes not particularly accurate, just enough so that ACE will see it as a problem, but in actual use it may only have little impact that the whitepoint is a bit off. So if you get a similar message when launching Photoshop, with the options “Use profile regardless” and “Ignore profile”, you may choose “Use profile regardless” and check visually or with the pipette in Photoshop if the inaccurate whitepoint poses a problem. This issue is fixed in Argyll CMS 1.3.3 and newer. Alternatively, you can create a Lab LUT profile.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-uac-cal-reset"><span>MS Windows Vista:</span> The calibration gets unloaded when a User Access Control prompt is shown</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> (Intel and Intel/AMD hybrid graphics users please see <a href="#issue-win-intel-cal-reset">“The Calibration gets unloaded after login/resume/User Access Control prompt”</a> first) This Windows Vista bug seems to have been fixed under Windows 7, and can be remedied under Vista by either manually reloading calibration, or disabling UAC—but please note that you sacrifice security by doing this. To manually reload the calibration, either open dispcalGUI and select “Load calibration curves from current display profile” in the “Options” menu, or (quicker) open the Windows start menu and select “dispcalGUI Profile Loader” in the “Startup” subfolder. To disable <acronym title="User Access Control">UAC<sup><a href="#definition_UAC">[9]</a></sup></acronym> (not recommended!), open the Windows start menu and enter “msconfig” in the search box. Click on the Tools tab. Select the line “Disable UAC” and click the “Launch” button. Close msconfig. You need to reboot your system for changes to apply.</dd>
				
				<dt id="issue-win-intel-cal-reset"><span>MS Windows with Intel graphics (also Intel/AMD hybrid):</span> The Calibration gets unloaded after login/resume/User Access Control prompt</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> The Intel graphics drivers contain several utilities that interfere with correct calibration loading. A workaround is to rename, move or disable (e.g. using a tool like <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902">AutoRuns</a>) the following files:
				<pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\igfxtray.exe
C:\Windows\system32\igfxpph.dll
C:\Windows\system32\igfxpers.exe</code></pre></dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-user-profile-not-used"><span>MS Windows Vista and 7:</span> The display profile isn't used if it was installed for the current user</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Windows start menu, select “Control Panel”, then “Color Management” (you may have to select “Classic View” under Vista and anything other than “Category View” under Windows 7 to see it). Under the “Devices” tab, select your display device, then tick “Use my settings for this device”.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-spyder2"><span>MS Windows:</span> Enabling the Spyder 2 colorimeter might fail when not running as administrator</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Run dispcalGUI as admin. Right-click dispcalGUI's icon and choose “Run as administrator...”</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-install-systemwide"><span>MS Windows:</span> Installing a display profile system-wide might fail when not running as administrator</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Run dispcalGUI as admin. Right-click dispcalGUI's icon and choose “Run as administrator...”</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win64-driversigenforcement"><span>MS Windows Vista and 7, 64-bit:</span> Driver signature enforcement prevents the installation of unsigned Argyll USB drivers</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Please upgrade to Argyll CMS 1.2.0 or later. For prior versions, signing the Argyll drivers or disabling driver signature enforcement altogether on each boot was needed to successfully use the drivers. <strong>Such workarounds are no longer needed with recent versions of Argyll CMS</strong> which include drivers that will work out-of-the-box (if you already have drivers for your measurement device installed, see “Updating Argyll drivers” under “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_MSWindows.html">Installing Argyll CMS on Microsoft Windows</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation if you use a prior version of the Argyll drivers, or “Adding Argyll drivers to existing drivers” if you are using vendor drivers).</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win7-autoloadcalibration"><span>MS Windows 7:</span> Calibration does not load automatically on login when not using the dispcalGUI Profile Loader</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Windows start menu, select “Control Panel”, then “Color Management” (you may have to select something other than “Category View” to see it). Select the “Advanced” tab, then “Change system defaults...”, and finally tick the “Use Windows display calibration” checkbox.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-winxp-multidisplay"><span>MS Windows XP, multiple displays:</span> One profile is used by all displays connected to a graphics card</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> The underlying issue is that Windows XP assigns color profiles per (logical) graphics card, not per output. Most XP graphics drivers present only one logical card to the OS even if the card itself has multiple outputs. There are several possible solutions to this problem:
					<ul>
						<li>Use different graphics cards and connect only one display to each (this is probably the preferable solution in terms of ease of use and is least prone to configuration error)</li>
						<li>Install and use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=1e33dca0-7721-43ca-9174-7f8d429fbb9e">Windows XP color control applet</a></li>
						<li>Some graphics cards, like the Matrox Parhelia APV (no longer produced), will expose two logical cards to the OS when using a specific vendor driver (some older ATI drivers also had this feature, but it seems to have been removed from newer ones)</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

				<dt id="issue-mac-dispcalgui-damaged"><span>Mac OS X:</span> dispcalGUI.app is damaged and can't be opened.</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the “Security &amp; Privacy” settings in System Preferences and set “Allow applications downloaded from” (under the “General” tab) to the “Anywhere” setting. After you have successfully launched dispcalGUI, you can change the setting back to a more secure option and dispcalGUI will continue to run properly.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-mac-pscursor"><span>Photoshop CS3 (Mac OS X):</span> Under Mac OS X, the brush cursor in Photoshop CS3 looks funny (box around brush)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> This seems to be a bug which shows with <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>-type profiles that have only one rendering intent. You can try to overcome it by selecting “Advanced...” next to the profile type dropdown, selecting an existing <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></acronym> profile as source (for hints as to which profile to select, see  “<a href="#settings_profiling_gamutmapping">Advanced gamut mapping options</a>”) and tick at least one of the “Apply gamut mapping to” checkboxes before profiling. To do that for an existing profile, adjust quality and profile name if you want, choose “Create profile from measurement data...” from the “Options” menu and select the profile. Note that this does not always solve the issue. Trying another profile type (XYZ LUT instead of L*a*b* LUT) might also help.</dd>				

				<dt id="issue-linux-lutaccess"><span>Linux/Windows:</span> No video card gamma table access (“Calibrate only” and “Calibrate &amp; profile” buttons grayed, “Profile only” button available)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Under Linux, please refer to the Argyll CMS documentation, “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_Linux.html">Installing the software on Linux with X11</a>” and “Note on X11 multi-monitor setups” / “Fixing access to Video LUTs” therein. Under Windows, please also see the solution posted under “<a href="#issue-win-user-profile-not-used">The display profile isn't used if it was installed for the current user</a>” if you are using Windows 7 and make sure you have a recent driver for your video card installed.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-linux-kdeqt"><span>Linux (KDE):</span> The application does not look native</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> You can use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gtk-qt-engine/">GTK-Qt Theme Engine</a> for native KDE look. Most Linux distributions offer ready-made packages through their packaging systems, search for “gtk-qt”. Another alternative is <a href="http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/gtk-kde4?content=74689">gtk-kde4</a>. Also, some themes come in versions for both KDE (Qt) and GTK.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-linux-libmtp"><span>Linux:</span> Instrument not working correctly/constantly disconnecting (conflict with libmtp)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> There is a bug on some systems with libmtp that causes instruments to continuously switch between connected and disconnected state.
				This seems to be a <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626010">bug in libmtp-runtime</a>.
				You can work around it by renaming <code>/lib/udev/mtp-probe</code> or updating to libmtp 1.0.6 where the issue should be fixed.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-english"><span>General:</span> Some text is still in english, even though another language is selected in the menu</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> All output from the Argyll CMS utilities is always english, and on Mac OS X, also the menuitems in the application menu. This is currently not changeable.</dd>

						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Testchart and preset improvements:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>All testcharts for LUT profiles have been complemented with additional single channel patches. This should in most cases improve average and maximum delta E of generated profiles, in some cases significantly. In fact, testing has shown that the new “small testchart for LUT profiles” with 154 patches total yields better results than the previous “extended testchart for LUT profiles” with 238 patches.</li>
									<li>The charts for curves + matrix profiles have been improved by adding a few additional body centered cubic grid patches - all the charts which are not tuned for a certain display type are body centered cubic grid based (this was also the case previously for the LUT testcharts, but not for the matrix charts).</li>
									<li>The patch order in the LUT charts has been optimized to improve measurement speed.</li>
									<li>The chart for gamma + matrix profiles has been removed in favor of the updated default chart for matrix profiles.</li>
									<li>New additional charts for LUT profiles have been added in various sizes.</li>
									<li>For each of the new charts for LUT profiles, starting from the “very large” size, optimized farthest-point-sampled versions have been added which are pre-conditioned for several common display types: sRGB tone response with Rec. 709 primaries and D65 whitepoint (consumer-grade displays), gamma 2.2 with Rec. 709 primaries and D65 whitepoint (consumer-grade displays, TVs), gamma 2.2 with AdobeRGB primaries and D65 whitepoint (entry-level and high-end graphics displays), L* tone response with NTSC primaries and D50 whitepoint (high-end graphics displays).</li>
									<li>The naming and patch count of the testcharts for LUT profiles has changed. The mapping that most closely resembles the old testcharts is as follows (total number of patches in parentheses):
										<ul>
											<li>Old “Default testchart for LUT profiles” (124) → new “Small testchart for LUT profiles” (154)</li>
											<li>Old “Extended testchart for LUT profiles” (238) → new “Default testchart for LUT profiles” (270)</li>
											<li>Old “Large testchart for LUT profiles” (396) → new “Extended testchart for LUT profiles” (442)</li>
											<li>Old “Very large testchart for LUT profiles” (912) → new “Very large testchart for LUT profiles” (994)</li>
											<li>Old “Massive testchart for LUT profiles” (2386) → new “Massive testchart for LUT profiles” (2527)</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							Use of the new charts is highly recommended. All presets have been updated to use the new chart types. The “prepress" preset has also been updated to generate a XYZ LUT profile by default.</li>
							<li>Detect if the instrument can use CCMX or CCSS colorimeter corrections based on the measurement mode. Disable colorimeter corrections for non-base display types.</li>
							<li>Correctly map measurement mode to DISPLAY_TYPE_BASE_ID for all supported instruments when creating CCMX.</li>
							<li>If a colorimeter correction with DISPLAY_TYPE_BASE_ID or DISPLAY_TYPE_REFRESH is selected, automatically set the correct measurement mode.</li>
							<li>If measuring the colorimeter correction testchart, automatically ensure a suitable measurement mode for colorimeters (if they support more than refresh and non-refresh measurement modes).</li>
							<li>Do not use spline interpolation for curve plots.</li>
							<li>Updated french translation, thanks to Loïc Guégant.</li>
							<li>Renamed calibration quality to calibration speed.</li>
							<li>Set calibration speed for all presets to medium.</li>
							<li>Standalone testchart editor: Parse first non-option argument as file to be opened.</li>
							<li>Testchart editor: Always generate good optimized points rather than fast.</li>
							<li>Testchart editor: Use existing file path when saving testchart.</li>
							<li>Testchart editor: Greatly improved the speed of paste operations when comparatively large data sets are used.</li>
							<li>Disallow -d and -D as extra arguments for Argyll's <code>targen</code> as the testchart editor only supports video RGB.</li>
							<li>Reset adaptive measurement mode when restoring defaults.</li>
							<li>Close all profile information windows when hiding the main window instead of just hiding them (don't reopen them when the main window is shown again).</li>
							<li>Curve viewer: Use float formatting for input RGB display.</li>
							<li>Only skip legacy serial ports if no instrument detected.</li>
							<li>Also specify Argyll <code>dispcal</code>/<code>dispread</code> -y parameter for spectrometers.</li>
							<li>Use Rec. 709 whitepoint chromaticity coordinates for “Video” preset.</li>
							<li>Changed profile installation error message for virtual display devices.</li>
							<li>Make it clearer which calibration is used when doing a “Profile only”: When a calibration file is going to be used, change the message from the warning “The current calibration curves will be used” to the informational “The calibration file <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> will be used” with the usual options to embed/not embed/reset video card gamma table.</li>
							<li>Allow the use of calibration curves when profiling a web display.</li>
							<li>When creating a colorimeter correction from profile(s), get the instrument name from the embedded TI3 if the data source is not EDID.</li>
							<li>Do not specify (superfluous and thus ignored) patch window positioning arguments for <code>dispcal</code>/<code>dispread</code> when using a virtual display.</li>
							<li>3D LUT: Removed black point compensation option (no longer easily possible because it now uses Argyll's <code>collink</code> internally. You can still have the effect of BPC by creating a display profile with BPC enabled and using it as destination profile during 3D LUT creation).</li>
							<li>Always copy/move temporary files to the save location if not a dry run, also in case of an error. If copy/move fails, keep them in the temporary directory and inform the user.</li>
							<li>Disable black point compensation for the “Prepress” preset (there are three presets without bpc - “madVR”, “Prepress” and “Softproof”) and use L* as calibration tone curve.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Show black point correction choice also when switching from refresh to any other measurement mode instead of only when switching from refresh to LCD measurement mode or vice versa.</li>
							<li>Corrected averaged RGB transfer function display.</li>
							<li>Adaptive measurement mode could not be disabled (regression of r1152 where adaptive measurement mode was made default in dispcalGUI).</li>
							<li>Work-around a very rare problem where a (bogus) display size of 0x0 mm is returned.</li>
							<li>Check if the configured colorimeter correction exists before adding it to the list.</li>
							<li>Update colorimeter correction and testchart lists after deleting settings files.</li>
							<li>Don't carry over colprof arguments from testchart file (fixes occasional wrong display model and manufacturer in profiles).</li>
							<li>Average, RMS and maximum delta E metadata was not added to profiles if equal to or greater than 10.</li>
							<li>Unhandled exception when 3D LUT window was opened and there was no profile selected under settings and also no display profile set.</li>
							<li>Unhandled exception if colorimeter correction does not exist.</li>
							<li>Standalone curve viewer: Fix loading of .cal file via commandline argument.</li>
							<li>Don't strip trailing zeros when displaying average gamma in the status bar of the profile information or curve window.</li>
							<li>Only set adaptive and hires measurement mode when the instrument supports it (fixes measurement mode switching to non-adaptive if toggling betweeen a colorimeter and a spectrometer).</li>
							<li>Mac OS X with Argyll CMS 1.5 and newer: Also search library folders for Argyll CMS support files (fixes imported colorimeter corrections not found).</li>
							<li>Only fall back to private copy of pnp.ids under Mac OS X and Windows.</li>
							<li>Updated link to Datacolor website download section for the Spyder 2 Windows installers.</li>
							<li>Transposed bits for EDID red y chromaticity coordinate.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer / profile info window: Reset tone response curve calculation when toggling LUT checkbox.</li>
							<li>Correctly react to detected display changes when the actual physical displays didn't change (e.g. when switching Argyll between versions supporting and not supporting the virtual “Web” display).</li>
							<li>Keypresses or cancel were not recognized during patch reading.</li>
							<li>Display uniformity measurements: Q or ESC had to be pressed twice to exit.</li>
							<li>Do not use “install profile” message for non-display profiles.</li>
							<li>3D LUT: “apply vcgt” checkbox stayed disabled after switching from a devicelink source profile to a non-devicelink source profile.</li>
							<li>Update all open windows when switching Argyll versions</li>
							<li>Do not reset selected colorimeter correction to none when selecting a preset or a settings file.</li>
							<li>Measurement window position was not correct when switching from web display.</li>
							<li>Show an error message when choosing a directory as profile save path where no subdirectories can be created.</li>
							<li>Python 2.7 compatibility: Mask u16Fixed16Number (fixes profile information not working for profiles with negative XYZ or chromaticity values when using Python 2.7).</li>
							<li>wxPython 2.9 compatibility: Do not specify number of rows in dynamically growing FlexGridSizer.</li>
							<li>Linux: Use colord's quirk_vendor_name to fix the manufacturer string.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X 10.6 and up: Clearing and loading calibration needs root privileges in some circumstances.</li>
							<li>Windows: Correctly escape quotes in arguments (fixes hang when profile name, program path or Argyll path contains a single quote).</li>
							<li>Windows: Show a meaningful error message when a subprocess can't be started instead of hanging indefinitely.</li>
							<li>Windows: Ignore WMI errors.</li>
							<li>Windows: Selecting testcharts saved in the root of a drive under Windows.</li>
							<li>Windows: Disable broken Windows 2000 support (was broken since 0.8.5.6 when the interactive display adjustment GUI was introduced and is not fixable as Windows 2000 does not implement the required AttachConsole functionality).</li>
							<li>Windows/Mac OS X: If Argyll profile installation failed, a success message was still shown.</li>

						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Reset default black point correction from automatic to off.</li>
							<li>If a profile contains no 'vcgt' tag, assume linear calibration.</li>
							<li>When creating a colorimeter correction, remember the last selected reference and colorimeter measurement file separately.</li>
							<li>When creating a colorimeter correction, automatically only use white, red, green and blue patches (at 100% device value each) from measurement files, regardless if they contain more patches. This allows re-using of measurement files with different patch counts (as long as they contain those four combinations) that have been created as by-product of other operations, e.g. during profiling. Note that measurements still need to be done under identical conditions and within reasonable timeframe (ideally less than a few minutes apart) to minimize effects of display and instrument drift when creating colorimeter corrections from them.</li>
							<li>When measuring the colorimeter correction testchart, automatically set the resulting measurement as last selected reference or colorimeter file depending on whether it contains spectral data or not.</li>
							<li>When restoring the current calibration after measuring the colorimeter correction testchart, do it silently (don't show a message window).</li>
							<li>Filter colorimeter corrections by selected instrument.</li>
							<li>Show colorimeter correction description in the dropdown instead of the filename. Show the filename and path on mouse hover.</li>
							<li>ColorHug: Only enable colorimeter corrections for “Factory” and “Raw” measurement modes.</li>
							<li>ColorHug: Automatically set “Factory” measurement mode when measuring the colorimeter correction testchart and measurement mode is not yet “Factory” or “Raw”. Restore previous measurement mode afterwards.</li>
							<li>Linux: Enable ColorHug support by default.</li>
							<li>Linux: colord wrapper now uses PyGObject instead of ctypes.</li>
							<li>Updated french translation, thanks to Loïc Guégant.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When creating a 3D LUT, don't fail if the target profile contains no 'vcgt' tag and the preference is “Apply calibration” (which is the default) irrespective of checkbox state.</li>
							<li>Use colorimeter correction (if applicable) from settings stored in calibration files and profiles when loading them.</li>
							<li>When creating a colorimeter correction, the display name in the description is now taken from the measurement file if available.</li>
							<li>When creating a colorimeter correction, automatically order the measurements exactly the same by device (RGB) triplets.</li>
							<li>Hide any profile information window(s) when the main window is hidden and restore them when it is shown again.</li>
							<li>Correct ID on profile created from EDID after adding gamut coverage/volume metadata.</li>
							<li>Measurement modes other than “LCD (generic)” and “Refresh (generic)” are now correctly restored from settings embedded in calibration files and profiles.</li>
							<li>If using the current calibration curves for profiling without calibrating (“Profile only” with “Reset video card gamma table” unchecked), using Argyll CMS 1.4.0, the resulting profile will now contain a 'vcgt' tag with the current calibration like with previous Argyll versions.</li>
							<li>RGB bars and chromaticity/color temperature readouts when adjusting a whitepoint with blackbody target are now working correctly.</li>
							<li>Ignore and do not show any explicitly selected Colorimeter Calibration Spectral Sample (CCSS) file for instruments that do not support it.</li>
							<li>Changing Argyll version/binaries in dispcalGUI with automatic instrument detection switched off is working correctly again without the need to restart the program.</li>
							<li>Show ColorHug-specific measurement modes (please run instrument detection once again to refresh the list if you already used the ColorHug in a previous version of dispcalGUI).</li>
							<li>Saturation gamut mapping settings are no longer ignored.</li>
							<li>Trying to view profile information for profiles whose black point X Y Z sum is zero will no longer result in a division by zero error.</li>
							<li>Black point compensation is no longer attempted if not atleast one black or white patch is found in measurement data.</li>
							<li>Linux: Don't error out if profile installation with dispwin fails, but profile installation via colord or oyranos-monitor is successful (fixes profile installation when using the distribution-packaged Argyll under Fedora)</li>
							<li>Linux: colord device key name now correctly adheres to device naming spec for xrandr devices (fixes some profile installation problems).</li>
							<li>Linux, Windows: Correctly detect in the profile loader if linear calibration is assumed when using Argyll CMS 1.4.0 or newer.</li>
							<li>Windows: Continuous measurements during interactive display adjustment are now stopped reliably when clicking the “Stop measurements” button or hitting the space key.</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>0.9.9.1</h3>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spyder 4 support if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.6. To make all measurement modes available, you have to use “Import correction matrices from other display profiling softwares...” from the “Tools” menu.</li>
							<li>Experimental ColorHug support is enabled through Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.6 if the <code>ENABLE_COLORHUG</code> environment variable is set, but the ColorHug currently doesn't work reliably across all platforms.</li>
							<li>Added information about <a href="#settings_measurement_modes">instrument measurement modes</a> to the ReadMe.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>GUI spring-cleaning: Re-arranged some controls and replaced radiobuttons and read-only combo-boxes with choice controls instead. Only the controls related to a selected choice are shown.</li>
							<li>Default calibration black point correction to automatic.</li>
							<li>Replaced previous 19-patch colorimeter correction testchart with smaller 4-patch version (just red, green, blue at 100% each and white, as is the default with Argyll CMS 1.3.6).</li>
							<li>Linux packages: Added Argyll CMS to dependencies. Please note: If you want the latest Argyll features or run into problems, it is recommemded to download the standalone Argyll binaries from argyllcms.com as the distribution repositories often only contain older Argyll CMS releases.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed unhandled exception when adding metadata to a profile from EDID that contains an invalid (out of range) gamma value.</li>
							<li>Fixed slightly off the mark whitepoint in resulting profile when using black point compensation (typical max. error 0.2 ΔE*76). You may want to <a href="#create_profile_from_measurement_data">re-create existing profiles</a>.</li>
							<li>Do not reset visibility of advanced calibration options when restoring defaults.</li>
							<li>Store black point compensation setting in profiles.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: The application bundle now again contains all required files (no missing files when dragging just the bundle to Mac OS X “Applications” folder).</li>
						</ul>

				<dt id="changelog-0.9.6.6">2012-03-15 14:45 (UTC) 0.9.6.6</dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>0.9.6.6</h3>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Black point compensation option for profiles (default ON).</strong> This effectively prevents black crush, but at the expense of accuracy of the resulting profile.</li>
							<li><strong>Profile information window with 2D gamut plot</strong> as well as information pane which shows profile header and tag data in detail (with few exceptions).</li>
							<li><strong>Ability to create display correction 3D LUTs</strong> for use in movie post-processing applications that don't have ICC support. Currently supported are the <code>.3dl</code> and <code>.cube</code> formats.</li>
							<li>Write gamut VRML files and calculate coverage and volume percentages against sRGB and Adobe RGB when creating profiles.</li>
							<li>Add 'chrm' tag (xy chromaticities for each primary) to created profiles. Unlike the values from 'rXYZ', 'gXYZ', 'bXYZ', A2Bx or 'clrt' tags, the 'chrm' data corresponds to the actual measured chromaticities without chromatic adaptation or interpolation. The 'chrm' tag is purely informational.</li>
							<li>Windows 7 and later: Added an option to let the operating system handle calibration loading when installing a profile (this option requires dispcalGUI to be run as Administrator and is also available in the dispcalGUI installer. If selecting the option there, the dispcalGUI Profile Loader will not be installed to the startup items. A shortcut to the loader is still available in the dispcalGUI folder in the start menu though, to be able to quickly force a reload of calibration).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Instrument detection now defaults to manual.</strong> A click on the icon with the swirling arrows or choosing the corresponding menu item in the “Options” menu detects connected instruments. Automatic instrument detection can be (re-)enabled/disabled there, too.</li>
							<li>The dispcalGUI Profile Loader can now be set to not show error messages again (errors will still be logged).</li>
							<li>Tone response curves are now plotted as L* → RGB by default and are also calculated for LUT profiles (profiles with both LUT and matrix TRC tags allow on-the-fly switching between them). In addition, the transfer function is shown if it can be estimated.</li>
							<li>Windows: Allow enabling/disabling of calibration loading on login when installing a profile (to be able to change this option when Windows 7 or later is set up to handle calibration loading, either dispcalGUI needs to be run as administrator or in the Windows color management control panel “Advanced” tab, click on “Change system defaults...” and disable “Use Windows display calibration”).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Do not fail to launch due to unhandled exception when parsing CGATS files containing KEYWORD, INDEX, SAMPLE_ID or DATA_FORMAT values in exponential notation.</li>
							<li>Do not use exponential notation for low (&lt; 0.0001) calibration black level target values.</li>
							<li>Correctly handle failed instrument calibration (by asking to repeat) and measurement failures which are not misreads or communication failures (and should thus not be retried automatically).</li>
							<li>Also look at ASCII descriptor blocks when determining the display device name from EDID (fixes display model not being set in profiles for certain Apple displays).</li>
							<li>Don't loose 'mmod' tag (monitor make and model) when creating a profile from measurement data embedded in an existing profile.</li>
							<li>Automatically restore calibration after measuring the colorimeter correction testchart.</li>
							<li>Restore Argyll CMS &lt; 1.3.0 compatibility (broken in 0.8.9.3).</li>
							<li>Windows Vista, 7 and later: Automatically enable “Use my settings for this device” in Windows' colormanagement settings when installing a profile.</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>0.8.9.3</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Selecting a smaller default testchart than the recommended one did not work (was reset to the recommended default when starting measurements or re-starting dispcalGUI).</li>
							<li>Restore previously selected testchart if canceling colorimeter correction measurements.</li>
							<li>Disable the “Measure” button in the “Create colorimeter correction” dialog if no display or instrument detected/selected.</li>
							<li>Disable menus while the main window isn't shown (only affects operating systems where the menu is not part of the main window e.g. Mac OS X).</li>
							<li>Linux: Fixed i1 Display Pro / ColorMunki Display missing from Argyll udev rules (this was actually already fixed in 0.8.5.2, but not mentioned in the changelog).</li>
							<li>Mac OS X Lion: Removed sporadic password dialog being shown after calibration measurements when running “Calibrate &amp; profile”.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X Lion: Fixed an issue with profile installation for the current user which only installed the profile for the root user, thus not making it available in system preferences and making e.g. the login screen the only visible place where it was effectively being used.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Allow the selection of LCD or CRT measurement modes for spectrometers too (determines the available controls during interactive display adjustment).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>GUI for interactive display adjustment.</li>
							<li>Add 'mmod' tag (monitor make and model, an Apple-specific private tag) to created profiles (ensures the profiles still show up in Mac OS X system preferences if “Show profiles for this display only” is ticked).</li>
						</ul>

					<dd>
						<h3>0.8.5.2</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Added missing numbers to “delta E too high” message when trying to upload a profile with low self-fit accuracy.</li>
							<li>Decoding of numerical manufacturer ID from EDID when adding metadata to a profile was done in the wrong byte order.</li>
							<li>Fixed missing terminating NUL character for copyright tag when creating a profile from EDID.</li>
							<li>Fixed missing underscore in EDID colorimetric metadata key names as per the <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_meta_Tag_for_Monitor_Profiles_0.1">ICC meta Tag for Monitor Profiles</a> specification.</li>
							<li>Linux: Display measurements couldn't be started if dispcalGUI was installed via the 0install feed.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: The file which maps Plug'n'Play device IDs to manufacturer names was not found when running from the application bundle, resulting in manufacturer entries in profiles always being equivalent to the three-letter PnP ID instead of the full manufacturer name.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Measurements for colorimeter corrections can now be started directly from the dialog, and the previous testchart is restored afterwards.</li>
							<li>Add more metadata to generated profiles to allow better automatic selection/ranking on systems that support it and standardized a few previously dispcalGUI-only keys (<a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_meta_Tag_for_Monitor_Profiles_0.1">ICC meta Tag for Monitor Profiles</a> / <a href="http://gitorious.org/colord/master/blobs/master/doc/metadata-spec.txt">GCM metadata specification</a>).</li>
							<li>Use product code as fallback for make/model when creating profiles from EDID.</li>
							<li>Windows: In case of an Argyll CMS 'config 1 failed' error upon trying to use an instrument, inform the user its driver may not be installed.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Added ability to specify the display technology for created colorimeter corrections.</li>
							<li>Enabled overriding of default gamut mapping intents for LUT profiles. “Luminance matched appearance” is the default override for perceptual intent, which provides an effect similar to black point compensation.</li>
							<li>The <a href="http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/colorimetercorrections/">colorimeter corrections database</a> now has a public web interface and API.</li>

						<h3>0.8.1.9</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Ignore 'unknown' (not required) fields when verifying CGATS (fixes bug 'invalid testchart' after profiling with spectrometer, introduced in r780).</li>
							<li>Force a default testchart if the selected one is invalid.</li>
							<li>Linux (autopackage): Set <code>PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=</code> (empty string) to fix installation on Mandriva 2011.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Default profile type should be 3x shaper + matrix, not single shaper + matrix.</li>
							<li>Some of the advanced calibration options (gamma type relative/absolute, ambient adjustment, black point correction and offset) are now hidden by default and can be shown via the corresponding menu item in the options menu.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Option to share profiles via the <a href="http://icc.opensuse.org/">openSUSE ICC Profile Taxi</a> service.</li>
							<li>Option to create profiles from extended display identification data (EDID).</li>
							<li>Linux (GNOME 3): <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/">colord</a> compatibility (query current profile, install &amp; set profile).</li>

						<h3>0.7.8.9</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Additional commandline arguments were ignored when doing profile verification measurements.</li>
							<li>Windows: If the startup folder in the start menu was deliberately deleted, the profile loader shortcut wasn't created when installing a profile.</li>
							<li>Windows: Profile loader correctly verifies if the calibration was sucessfully loaded.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Skip legacy serial ports by default when detecting instruments (serial instruments like the DTP92 or Spectrolino will no longer be selectable unless you manually set <code>skip_legacy_serial_ports = 0</code> in <code>dispcalGUI.ini</code> or use a serial to USB adapter).</li>
							<li>Windows: The profile loader shortcut in the startup folder inside the start menu is now created at installation time (and removed when uninstalling).</li>
							<li>When checking for program updates, show the changelog for the new version if an update is available.</li>
							<li>Confirm enabling of debugging output.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Support for Argyll CMS 1.3.4 features: i1 Display Pro and Colormunki Display, Colorimeter Calibration Spectral Sample (.ccss) files.</li>
							<li>Ability to import colorimeter corrections from other display profiling softwares. Currently iColor Display, i1 Profiler and ColorMunki Display are supported.</li>
							<li>Ability to create correction matrices and Calibration Spectral Sample files, with the option to share them via an online database.</li>
							<li>Option to automatically check for program updates on startup.</li>
							<li>Added <a href="#issue-linux-libmtp">information how to fix instrument not working correctly/constantly disconnecting under Linux due to a conflict with libmtp</a> (thanks to Pascal Obry who notified me of the issue back in May 2011).</li>

						<h3>0.7.3.7</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: Fixed multi-display support when not using separate X screens.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Fixed not being able to run under a standard user account, and Mac OS X 10.7 compatibility.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X 10.4.x: Fixed functionality requiring elevated privileges, e.g. installing profiles system wide or enabling the Spyder 2 using Argyll 1.1.x (regression of a change introduced in r706 / 0.7.0.7)</li>
							<li>Windows: Fixed several problems with special characters in paths which are not representable through the file system encoding.</li>
							<li>Windows: Worked around OS localtime() bug. If the system's clock was set to a date far into the future, dispcalGUI failed to launch on subsequent runs because of the logfile's timestamp which could not be processed by localtime().</li>
							<li>Windows Vista/7: Querying the user display profile resulted in a “not found” error if the checkbox “Use my settings for this device” was never ticked in Windows' color management control panel, failing the fallback of querying the system display profile in case of no user display profile.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>All presets now use curves + matrix as profile type (for better overall application compatibility).</li>
							<li>Better feedback when trying to open broken/invalid files (display an error dialog instead of just logging the error).</li>
							<li>Icons in the task switcher on Windows Vista/7 (and presumably Linux) should now be crisp and not pixelated.</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>0.7.0.7</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>wxPython 2.8.12 compatibility.</li>
							<li>Linux: Preserve environment when installing a profile system-wide so $DISPLAY is available for dispwin.</li>
							<li>Linux (Source): Changed highest supported Python version to “lower than 3.0” because openSUSE Build Service would choke on “lower than or equal to 2.7” when building for Ubuntu 11.04.</li>
							<li>Linux (Source): Fixed setup.py bdist_deb as far as possible (see notes under <a href="#install-src">installing from source</a>, additional setup commands, bdist_deb)</li>
							<li>Windows: Fixed error when the display profile cannot be determined (e.g. when running remotely).</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>0.7.0.0</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updating profile verification reports created in versions prior to revision 672 should not strip calibration and gray balance information anymore (regression of a change in r672).</li>
							<li>If the Spyder 2 was enabled using Argyll CMS 1.2 or newer, this should now be reflected correctly in the “Tools” menu by a checkmark next to the “Enable Spyder 2” menu item.</li>
							<li>Linux (Autopackage, DEB and RPM installs) and source: Fixed missing application icons in sizes other than 16x16 and 32x32 if the source archive was created with setup.py under Mac OS X or Windows (regression of a change in r501).</li>
							<li>Linux/Windows: The location of the Argyll binaries was not stored in the system-wide configuration, which could prevent the profile loader from finding the Argyll binaries if they were not on the PATH environment variable and a profile was installed system-wide.</li>
							<li>Windows: Fixed program termination if EnumDisplayDevices fails (e.g. when running remotely).</li>
							<li>Windows: Fixed program termination if a display device has no driver entry in the registry (the very generic Windows error message is misleading in that case: It pretends a file was not found).</li>
							<li>Windows XP: Correctly enumerate display device names and EDID.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When doing verification measurements of a (non-Argyll) profile containing a chromatic adaptation 'chad' tag, dispcalGUI now tries to use the same chromatic adaptation transform to calculate adapted values from the measurements instead of using a hardcoded Bradford transform.</li>
							<li>The default delta E formula for “RGB + gray balance” evaluation is now DE 2000.</li>
							<li>The delta E formula is now locked for the Fogra MediaWedge and IDEAlliance Control Strip evaluation criteria.</li>
							<li>The “Update calibration” and “Update profile” checkboxes were combined into one. This removes the ambiguity about what “Update profile” functionality actually was: Only updating the calibration inside the profile. Both updating stand-alone calibration '.cal' files and calibrations embedded in profiles are now handled with the single “Update calibration” checkbox. The slightly different workflow of only updating the calibration, and then creating an actual new profile on top of it in one go, is still possible by explicitly loading a calibration '.cal' file under “Settings”.</li>
							<li>Made the GUI a bit nicer towards low screen resolutions by moving more controls into the scrollable area and also removing the graphical banner and allowing horizontal scrollbars if things get really cramped.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista/7 and later: To be able to install a profile system-wide, you now need to run dispcalGUI explicitly as administrator (right-click the dispcalGUI icon, then select “Run as administrator”) to show the appropriate controls in the profile installation dialog.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Documentation: Updated the information for <a href="#issue-win-photoshop-monprofdefect">Photoshop's “The monitor profile […] appears to be defective”</a> message under <a href="#issues">Known issues and solutions</a>.</li>

							<li>wxPython 2.9 compatibility.</li>
							<li>Windows: Potential COM error caused by obsolete code.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista/7: Potential WMI errors when trying to read a display's EDID are now suppressed (the EDID can not be read on systems where WMI has errors, which may prevent more accurate display descriptions, but will not impede functionality otherwise).</li>

							<li>Re-enabled warning message from the profile loader if the calibration in the video card does not match the requested calibration after loading.</li>
							<li>Fixed “Show curves” checkbox in the profile installation dialog not doing anything if the curve viewer was not shown before (regression of a change in version 0.6.2.2).</li>
							<li>Fixed a small visual glitch where the message “Calibration complete” was not cleared from the progress window after instrument calibration.</li>
							<li>Fixed possibility of unprintable characters from EDID strings (e.g. display name) causing errors.</li>
							<li>Fixed Argyll CMS diagnostic output not working for dispwin when using Argyll CMS 1.3.1</li>
							<li>Linux: Fixed Autopackage install not working with Python 2.7</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: Added a “Load profile and calibration on login” checkbox to the profile installation dialog. Normally, you want to keep this checked, so that dispcalGUI's profile loader can setup the configured display(s). But if you use another solution for loading profiles, like Oyranos with the CompICC plugin, you should uncheck it, so that display profiles are solely handled by CompICC.</li>

						<h3>0.6.5.3</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed a bug where the wrong correction matrix setting was stored in a profile or calibration file when changing the correction matrix, and creating a profile with a previous settings file selected which used a different correction matrix. Note this didn't affect measurements when creating the new profile or calibration file, but when loading it in dispcalGUI, the correction matrix used for the previously selected settings file was set instead of the one actually used when creating the new file.</li>
							<li>Fixed missing XYZ values for the assumed whitepoint in profile verification reports.</li>
							<li>Fixed crash when the manufacturer ID from a display's EDID contains invalid data.</li>
							<li>Honor the selected display when loading calibration curves from a settings file.</li>
							<li>Linux: Installing profiles under multi-display configurations using separate X screens should now work better when Oyranos is installed (previously, when the profile for the second screen was installed after the profile for the first screen, it would override the first profile in the Oyranos configuration. Profiles can be re-installed with this version of dispcalGUI to fix this).</li>
							<li>Linux: Profile loader: When Oyranos is installed, but not xcalib, the fallback to dispwin to load the calibration curves was not working.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Reset additional commandline arguments too when restoring defaults.</li>
							<li>The profile loader will no longer show an error message when unable to determine a display's current ICC profile, as there may just not be any profile installed for the respective display. Instead, such errors are now silently logged.</li>
							<li>Improved error messages from the profile loader by adding some information about the affected display for easier troubleshooting of multi-display configurations.</li>
							<li>Windows: Profile installation: When a system-wide autostart entry for the calibration loader already exists, do not create a per-user entry.</li>
							<li>Linux: The autopackage can now be installed just for the current user. Note this will not setup instrument access though, as that requires root privileges.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Save the device model and manufacturer description to measurement data (.ti3) files and use that information when creating a profile.</li>
							<li>Log all output from the profile loader.</li>
							<li>Ability to just measure a testchart and create a measurement data file (menu “Options”, “Measure testchart”).</li>
							<li>Approximate gamma for grayscales is shown in profile verification reports.</li>

							<li>When the measurement window was moved to the leftmost and/or topmost coordinates of the screen, the calculated relative position could become negative and prevent starting measurements.</li>
							<li>Trying to profile a display which provides an empty model description via EDID no longer fails.</li>
							<li>Profile name placeholder %im (instrument measurement mode) now inserts the correct string.</li>
							<li>Profiling did not finish if “Show actual calibration curves from video card gamma table” was checked and the curves window shown.</li>
							<li>Fixed black point correction rate not being restored correctly when loading settings.</li>
							<li>Fixed conversion of the color temperature to xy chromaticity coordinates (the input fields in the GUI) which was erroneously being calculated with the formula for daylight even if a blackbody locus was chosen.</li>
							<li>Fixed assumed whitepoint in profile verification reports erroneously being calculated  with the formula for daylight even if a blackbody locus was originally chosen when creating the profile.</li>
							<li>Fixed profile verification reports not working in Internet Explorer 5.x-6.0 and Opera 7.x.</li>
							<li>Fixed profile verification reports showing “missing data” for some fields if using the Fogra Media Wedge V3 criteria and the reference file contained both XYZ and Lab data.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: A double extension (.icc.icm) is no longer added when creating a profile from an existing one (menu “Options”, “Create profile from measurement data...”).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When loading settings from calibration (.cal) files, the actual parameters chosen when calibrating are now set instead of stored measured values (e.g. whitepoint, black- and white level. Will only work for .cal files created in this version and up).</li>
							<li>“Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” (in the “Options” menu) for characterization readings after calibration is now disabled by default to help sensor stability (especially for the ColorMunki).</li>
							<li>Black point correction rate now uses a floating-point control with the range 0.05...20.0 (consistent with the Argyll CMS dispcal commandline tool) instead of the previous integer control with the range 5...2000.</li>
							<li>The default evaluation criteria for RGB testcharts in profile verification reports is now RGB only.</li>
							<li>The default Delta E formula used for results in profile verification reports is now Delta E 2000 (except for standardised criteria like the Fogra Media Wedge V3).</li>
							<li>Additional statistics in profile verification reports are now hidden by default.</li>
							<li>Selecting “CMYK” or “RGB” in profile verification reports now actually makes a difference (shows the corresponding device values in the overview).</li>
							<li>“Evaluate gray balance through calibration only” in profile verification reports is now disabled by default.</li>
							<li>Windows: Installing a profile system-wide removes an existing user autostart entry for the profile loader to avoid having two entries.</li>
							<li>Windows: EDID info will be used if available instead of generic device strings ('PnP-Monitor' et al).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Ability to enable Argyll CMS diagnostic (debugging) output for measurements via menu “Options”.</li>

						<h3>0.5.8.0</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The timeout of 10 seconds for the startup of Argyll tools and instrument initialization was too short for some instruments and is now increased to 30 seconds. If the timeout is ever exceeded, dispcalGUI should now also abort automatically and no longer hang.</li>
							<li>When previewing the calibration upon profile installation, use a linear calibration if no display profile is present when toggling the preview on and off (fixes the curve viewer not updating).</li>
							<li>Fixed closing the log window not re-enabling the “show log automatically” menuitem.</li>
							<li>Linux (Autopackage install): Fixed menu entry sometimes disappearing permanently after logging out under GNOME.</li>
							<li>Linux: Fixed dispcalGUI not working if libX11 or libXrandr do not expose certain functions (e.g. under Mandriva 2009).</li>
							<li>Linux: Fixed not being able to install a profile using GNOME Color Manager when the profile was not writable.</li>
							<li>Linux: Fixed not being able to install a profile using Oyranos when the profile was not located in ~/.color/icc/devices/display.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: Saving a log file from the log window now works correctly.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: The terminal should no longer lose its focus when the measurement area is shown. This should also make the mouse cursor reappear which is otherwise hidden by dispcal/dispread.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X 10.6: The current display profile should now be determined correctly (e.g. for the curve viewer) when loading its calibration curves or selecting the “&lt;Current&gt;” settings.</li>
							<li>Windows (installer): An unused console window is no longer shown when launching dispcalGUI via the installed shortcuts.</li>
							<li>Windows: Fixed executable not working under Windows 2000.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Do not pass through the “hit any key to retry” message from Argyll CMS tools to the progress dialog in case of misreads/port communication problems (retries happen automatically, so there is no need and also no possibility for keyboard interaction).</li>
							<li>Enabling the Spyder 2 is now less cumbersome if the original installation CD is not available (especially on Mac OS X, where the firmware couldn't be found if a recent version of the Spyder 2 software was installed) and should work with the downloadable Spyder 2 software installers (but they need to be run to install the software first because the firmware can't be extracted from the installer binaries directly). Messages are now hopefully more informative to give a better idea of what to do. If the firmware can't be extracted from the Spyder 2 software installer, you are asked to install the software and try again. If that can't be done because of platform incompatibility (Linux), the last choice is to locate the Spyder.lib/CVSpyder.dll file manually (it must be copied from a Mac OS X or Windows system in that case).</li>
							<li>Linux: Allow installation of profiles using GNOME Color Manager even if XRandR is not working/available.</li>
							<li>Linux: Installation now checks for existing udev rules/hotplug scripts for instruments and only installs its own rules if none exist yet.</li>
							<li>Linux/Windows: The profile loader will now show a warning dialog if a profile couldn't be loaded.</li>
							<li>Linux/Windows: Device model and manufacturer are added to profiles if <acronym title="Extended Display Identification Data">EDID<sup><a href="#definition_EDID">[10]</a></sup></acronym> info is available.</li>

				<dt id="changelog-0.4.9.2">2010-06-29 19:23 (UTC) 0.4.9.2</dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>0.4.9.2</h3>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spectrometer sensor calibration sometimes accidentally occured when the instrument was still attached to the screen, leading to erroneous subsequent readings.</li>
							<li>Immediately close a profile after reading to avoid locking it (fixes not being able to delete files from within the GUI).</li>
							<li>Fixed quirks in “update calibration” and “update profile” operation.</li>
							<li>The system-wide installation option in the profile install dialog is no longer hidden just because a profile has no embedded calibration curves (vcgt tag).</li>
							<li>If the calibration curves of the current display profile couldn't be loaded for some reason (broken video card gamma table access, or no profile set), the curve viewer was not yet shown, and then a profile under “Settings” was selected, and then deleted, and then the curve viewer called up, an unhandled exception was raised.</li>
							<li>Fixed ambient measurement via the “Measure” buttons timing out with the ColorMunki and various error handling issues regardless of instrument which could lead to an un-cancelable, forever looping progress bar.</li>
							<li>Fixed ambient color temperature measurement via the “Measure” button not updating the kelvin field if selected.</li>
							<li>Linux (only if the detected filesystem encoding is not UTF-8), Mac OS X and Windows: When installing a profile with “special” characters in the filename (everything not representable as 7-bit ASCII), it is now given an unique name containing the display number and MD5 hash, which fixes a few problems with filename encoding under Linux and Mac OS (under Linux the profile couldn't be successfully installed, under Mac OS X system-wide installation partly broke). This also fixes an issue under Windows where a profile whose name starts with the same first few characters (but has not the same name) as an already existing file in the system profile directory could accidentally overwrite that file, because I had not considered that filenames returned by win32api.GetShortPathName are only unique for the directory where a given file resides—and upon installation, that is the profile storage directory, not the system profile directory.</li>
							<li>Linux, Mac OS X: When installing a profile, interaction with the curves window works now while the installation dialog is shown.</li>
							<li>Windows (standalone executable): Fixed ambient measurement via the “Measure” buttons reproducably hanging (regardless of instrument) if the MS Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) was not installed.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: <a href="http://oyranos.org/">Oyranos</a> support. If it is available, profiles are imported to the Oyranos database using <code>oyranos-monitor</code> upon installation, and an appropriate autostart entry is created to load calibration curves and setup the X _ICC_PROFILE atoms on login.</li>
							<li>Linux: Rudimentary support for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-color-manager/">GNOME Color Manager</a>. If it is available and XRandR is working, profiles are imported to GCM upon installation. Any calibration loaders created previously by dispcalGUI will be removed (except the possible <code>oyranos-monitor</code> entry). You then still have to manually assign the profile to a display in the GCM preferences by selecting it and then choosing the profile from the dropdown menu (in the future, this process will be made obsolete by using GCM library functions). Loading of calibration curves and setting up the X _ICC_PROFILE atom and XRandR output properties is then handled by GCM.</li>
							<li>Menu option to automatically show the log window after certain operations (measurements, profile creation).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><em>The terminal window is now only shown when required (e.g. keyboard interaction during interactive display adjustment).</em> Also, the terminal used is no longer an external application, but a minimal emulator that just passes keyboard input to the Argyll CMS tools.</li>
							<li><em>All measurements which do not require keyboard interaction with Argyll CMS tools now show a progress dialog with the option to cancel the measurements.</em> All output that was previously visible through the terminal is still available via the log window (“Tools” menu) and -file.</li>
							<li>Always load calibration curves before installing a profile, even if the profile has no vcgt tag (resets calibration to linear).</li>
							<li>Automatically scroll to bottom when messages are added to the log window.</li>
							<li>Store calibration and profiling settings in extra sections inside the TI3 file instead of the profile copyright tag. Use “generic” copyright information (“Created with dispcalGUI <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> and Argyll CMS <code>&lt;version&gt;</code>”), overridable by adding a line <code>copyright = My copyright information</code> in dispcalGUI's configuration file.</li>
							<li>Made sure that only 7-bit ASCII gets written to a profile's copyright, ASCII description, and ASCII device model description. ICC v2 Unicode and Mac ScriptCode descriptions are now also written by default.</li>
							<li>Presets default to high profile quality.</li>
							<li>Remember visible state of curves, log window and testchart editor.</li>
							<li>Updated french translation (thanks).</li>
							<li>Linux: Unattended calibration &amp; profiling no longer depends on xautomation.</li>
							<li>Linux: <acronym title="Extended Display Identification Data">EDID<sup><a href="#definition_EDID">[10]</a></sup></acronym> is now used (if available) when generating descriptive identifiers for displays.</li>
							<li>Linux: When determining a display's associated profile, check XrandR _ICC_PROFILE output properties first if available.</li>
							<li>Linux: The option to install a profile system-wide is not offered if using <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-color-manager/">GNOME Color Manager</a> to install profiles (GCM has its own way to set profiles as system default).</li>
							<li>Linux (only when <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-color-manager/" title="GNOME Color Manager">GCM</a> is not installed or XRandR is not working), Mac OS X, Windows: Installing a profile system-wide now also sets it as default for the current user.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista and later: The option to install a profile system-wide is no longer offered if using Argyll CMS &lt;= 1.1.1 (system scope in Argyll releases up to 1.1.1 acts like user scope on those systems).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>+ Numerous other small fixes and changes. There is now also a mailing list for discussion and support as well as announcements (see at the <a href="#contact">top</a> of this document).</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Fixed unreliable (hanging occasionally) profile install when using system scope under Linux and Mac OS X (regression of a change in SVN r391 / 0.3.9.3).</li>
							<li>Fixed ICC profile truncation if actual tag data is not in the same order as the tag table (regression of a change in SVN r274 / 0.3.0.7. Argyll profiles were not affected).</li>
							<li>Fixed potential invalid profile name being generated if some unicode characters can't be conveyed in the file system encoding (Windows, Linux).</li>
							<li>Fixed possible backslash in profile name due to wrong escaping when replacing invalid characters.</li>
							<li>Fixed support for codepages 65000 (UTF-7) and 65001 (UTF-8) in the main application under Windows. This is actually a fix for shortcomings of Python.</li>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Show percentage and amount of tone values per channel (+ grayscales) for calibration curves in the curve viewer and profile verification reports.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: Enabled gray balance evaluation for all RGB charts containing grayscales (R=G=B). Added option to verify graybalance through calibration only (sets the target L* of each grayscale patch to the measured L* and target a*=b*=0).</li>
							<li>Added documentation for the interactive display adjustment part of calibration.</li>
							<li>Added further documentation of the profile verification feature with detailed information about underlying technical aspects.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed an unicode error after creating a profile verification report in a path containing unicode characters and a few other unrelated (potential) unicode errors.</li>
							<li>Fixed potential unhandled exception if a JSON language file is malformed.</li>
							<li>Fixed unhandled exception (local variable referenced before assignment) if trying to view calibration curves of an output with no video card gamma table access.</li>
							<li>Fixed rare unhandled exception (local variable referenced before assignment) if logfile couldn't be renamed or removed during rollover.</li>
							<li>Fail more gracefully (omit traceback from error message) if temp directory couldn't be created.</li>
							<li>Fixed handling of XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and the system-wide autostart directory if the preferred configuration directory does not exist under Linux when installing a profile in local system scope, which prevented the system-wide autostart entry to be created.</li>
							<li>Correctly determine system display profile under Windows Vista and 7 if no user profile is set. Fall back to sRGB if no display profile is set.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Changed default gamma from 2.4 to 2.2 in an attempt to increase the amount of available gamma table tone values after calibration for LCD screens, which often have a native response that is closer to a gamma of 2.2 than 2.4.</li>
							<li>Changed default profile type to single curve + matrix.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: Only evaluate grayscales (R=G=B) if their luminance is atleast 1% of the white luminance. Also evaluate combined Δa and Δb range.</li>
							<li>Moved instrument feature details to separate JSON configuration file.</li>
							<li>Made compatible with wxPython 2.8.6.0.</li>

						<h3>0.3.8.0</h3>
						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>“Very large” testchart with 912 patches.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: Support (non-Argyll) profiles which use chromatic adaption.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Improved error message when Argyll binaries are not found (only files not found are now shown, together with alternatives). Automatically fall back to xicclu if icclu is not found (eg. Ubuntu's Argyll 1.0.3 package doesn't contain icclu).</li>
							<li>Fixed 'invalid syntax' error when running under Python 2.5.</li>
							<li>Profile verification report: Fixed a parsing error when reference or measurement data contained numbers in exponential notation.</li>
							<li>Linux: Unhandled exception if DISPLAY environment variable is in the format <code>[host]:displaynumber</code> instead of <code>[host]:displaynumber.screennumber</code> (eg. <code>:0</code> instead of <code>:0.0</code>).</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Fixed values entered in combo boxes not updating the configuration correctly under some circumstances.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile verification: Lookup device values relative colorimetrically and adapt the measured values to D50 before comparison (using Bradford matrix), so that the measured whitepoint corresponds to L*a*b* 100 0 0. Please note that verification results obtained with reference files measured in earlier versions of dispcalGUI should not be compared to those obtained via this new approach if the display whitepoint is not D50, as the results are likely to be different as an effect of the relative lookup and the chromatic adaption.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: Improved support for non-Argyll CGATS text files. Handling is as follows:
								<ul>
									<li>If the file contains RGB_R RGB_G RGB_B fields, it is handled like a Argyll *.ti1 (testchart) file—any XYZ or Lab data is ignored and the RGB numbers are sent to the display and measured. Afterwards, the measured values are compared to the expected values, which are obtained by sending the RGB numbers through the profile. If RGB values above 100 are found, a range of 0-255 is assumed. Otherwise, a range of 0-100 (like Argyll *.ti1) is assumed.</li>
									<li>If the file doesn't contain RGB_R RGB_G RGB_B fields, but XYZ_X XYZ_Y XYZ_Z or LAB_L LAB_A LAB_B, it is handled like a Argyll measurement data (*.ti3) file—the values are used to lookup corresponding RGB numbers through the profile and these are then sent to the display and measured. Afterwards, the measured values are compared to the original XYZ or Lab values.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Profile verification report: Show measured whitepoint and assumed target color temperature (based on closest daylight temperature), and use them to calculate the Delta E for the whitepoint. A few performance improvements when processing large datasets with several hundred or thousand measurements.</li>
							<li>GUI and ReadMe: Changed all occurences of the term “LUT curves” to “calibration curves” and also changed all occurences of the term “video LUT” to “video card gamma table” to better distinguish from “LUT profile”. Also renamed the “LUT viewer” to curve viewer as a more accurate description of its functionality.</li>

							<li>Profile verification report: Depending on the chart used, you can now choose among different evaluation criteria from within the report. Also added Fogra Media Wedge V3 tolerance values for CMYK testcharts.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile verification: Error 'Unknown color representation Lab' when trying to verify a L*a*b* LUT profile.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: Wrong XYZ scaling when reading from *.ti3 files containing XYZ, but no L*a*b* values.</li>
							<li>Profile verification: When measuring a display other than the first one, the calibration curves were erroneously still loaded to the 1st display.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Testchart editor: Do not automatically select a saved testchart (regression of a change in 0.3.3.5). Do not show empty rows when creating a testchart using an algorythm that does not create the expected number of rows.</li>
							<li>Bumped wxPython version check to 2.8.8.0 so a proper error message is displayed if wxPython is too old.</li>
							<li>Linux: When using TwinView or Xinerama, the size of the measurement window was sometimes not correct.</li>
							<li>Linux: Failure in get_argyll_version if Argyll utilities have alternate names (eg. argyll-targen instead of targen), which could prevent being able to open the testchart editor (regression of a change in 0.3.3.5).</li>
							<li>Mac OS X 10.4: Fall back to ColorSyncScripting if Image Events does not return a display profile.</li>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Capability to set whitepoint or ambient light level for viewing condition adjustment by measuring ambient light.</li>
							<li>Profile name %tpa placeholder (test patch amount).</li>
							<li>Documentation for ambient light level viewing conditions adjustment, advanced profiling options (gamut mapping) and testchart editor in the ReadMe. Also a few additions to the existing whitepoint/white level and tone curve documentation (mostly taken from the Argyll CMS documentation).</li>
							<li>Two entries to the <a href="#issues">known issues &amp; solutions</a> section in the ReadMe (swapped colors and Photoshop “Monitor profile appears to be defective”).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>New improved testcharts and presets, with lower patch counts:</strong> 12 patches default for gamma+matrix profiles, 48 patches default for curves+matrix profiles (former chart had 91 patches), 124 patches default for LUT profiles which should actually be usable this time around when coupled with a profile quality setting of “high”, unlike its predecessor with 127 patches which yielded mediocre results at best (but for increased accuracy, the new 238-patch “extended” testchart is recommended). 396 and 2386-patch charts (the new “large” and “massive” quantity) are also included.</li>
							<li>Default to high profile quality (and force for gamma+matrix profiles, as there is no processing penalty like for curves+matrix or LUT profiles).</li>
							<li>Removed limit for remembered settings files.</li>
							<li>When calibration or profiling measurements fail, first show the main application window, then the error message (small dialog boxes are sometimes hard to spot on big screens if the application context is missing).</li>
							<li>Moved profile quality, type and advanced settings above testchart selector (this order is more logical, as profile quality and type influences testchart selection).</li>
							<li>Testchart editor: Default to adaption of 10% for testchart creation using optimized farthest point sampling (OFPS). Support both device and L*a*b* diagnostic VRML files when creating testcharts using Argyll &gt;= 1.1.0. No longer calculate the amount of white/gray/single color patches or multidimensional cube steps if info is missing in testchart file (calculations take way too long for little added benefit).</li>
							<li>Cleaned up the <a href="#issues">known issues &amp; solutions</a> section in the ReadMe.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Wrong value for adaption settings in testchart editor being stored.</li>
							<li>Linux (cosmetic): Incorrect special characters in console window when using non-english locale under certain configurations (regression of a change introduced in 0.3.0.7).</li>
							<li>Non-critical: File information in Argyll CGATS TI1 to TI3 conversion.</li>

							<li>dispcalGUI version now corresponds to SVN revision number, split into its digit components. Build system (setup.py) uses SVN to generate version information.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Curve viewer: When no display is selected (i.e. when Argyll binaries are not found), it will now try to show the vcgt of the 1st display's profile.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer: When hiding the viewer and loading different calibration curves, those changes were not reflected when showing the viewer again.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer: If a profile does not contain a 'vcgt' tag, clear canvas and disable R/G/B checkboxes.</li>
							<li>Selection of display used for video card gamma table access not working correctly.</li>
							<li>Loading of calibration upon initial preview in profile installation dialog if profile does not contain dispcalGUI settings.</li>
							<li>Do not show failure message if user cancels profile installation via the password dialog when installing in system scope.</li>
							<li>In some cases, values read from the configuration file were not correctly validated (would only show with deliberately altered or broken config file).</li>
							<li>colprof output is no longer swallowed when creating a matrix profile with Argyll versions &lt;= 1.0.4.</li>
							<li>Linux: Fall back to ASCII if detected encoding is not UTF-8 to fix profile install issues.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: Enabling the Spyder 2 colorimeter might need elevated privileges.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: When installing a profile in local system scope, the necessary password was not accepted under newer Linux distros and also Mac OS X &gt; 10.4.11</li>
							<li>Mac OS X (cosmetic): Suppress spurious AppleScript messages.</li>
							<li>Windows: Get display profile via registry instead of Windows API because the latter does not reflect runtime changes to profile associations (you still need to refresh the curve viewer when changing profile associations <em>outside</em> of dispcalGUI while it is running).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Known issues in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: You can't interact with the drop-down menu or the checkboxes in the curve viewer while a profile installation dialog is shown.</li>

							<li>fix: Only look at &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt; during the Python version check (fixes a critical error on Ubuntu 9.10 Beta, where the Python revision number has an unexpected value).</li>
							<li>fix: The curve viewer is now also able to plot calibration curves from *.cal files.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux): If launched on an X display which is not the first display, the measurement window's location no longer determines the display which is used for measurements. This allows non-Xinerama multiscreen configurations to work with dispcalGUI. Note: You need to launch dispcalGUI on the display you want to measure, e.g. <code>`DISPLAY=:0.1 dispcalGUI`</code>.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux): Get the profile from the correct display when loading a display's calibration curves into the curve viewer.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux, cosmetic): Suppress CUPS warnings encountered on some systems when using the curve viewer.</li>
							<li>fix (Mac OS X): Do not offer 'Network' scope during profile installation if <code>/Network/Library/ColorSync/Profiles</code> does not exist.</li>
							<li>fix (Windows, cosmetic): Made sure the message "Debug: src/helpers.cpp(140): 'CreateActCtx' failed with error 0x0000007b (the filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.)" is not shown when launching the standalone Windows executable, by changing the way *.pyd files are bundled (they are now copied to the executable's directory and are no longer part of the executable itself).</li>

							<li>fix (Windows): several errors related to character encoding.</li>

							<li>fix: (Windows) several actions unexpectedly failing under Windows 7 (dispcalGUI created temporary files via system calls on several occasions, but on Windows, this does not create the file in the user's temp directory as one would expect, but in the ROOT directory e.g. C:\—a sane method is now being used instead).</li>
							<li>fix: bug in sorting function caused leading and trailing zeroes of numbers in testchart filenames to get lost, thus failing to load such files.</li>
							<li>fix: (Linux) “No module named _md5” error with the standalone executable on some Linux distros (apparently an OpenSSL-related issue, because normally it wouldn't fall back to the legacy _md5 module which is not even built by default in recent Python versions). The fallback _md5 module is now included.</li>
							<li>fix: calibration was not automatically added &amp; selected in the dropdown menu when only calibrating.</li>
							<li>fix: dropping a profile which was not created in dispcalGUI onto the application window no longer results in an unhandled error.</li>
							<li>fix: when trying to load calibration curves from a profile which actually does not contain any, an error message is now shown instead of resetting the video card gamma table to linear and erroneously stating the curves were succesfully loaded.</li>
							<li>fix: add display device name as device model description when profiling.</li>
							<li>fix: when creating a new profile from an existing profile, use that profile's device model description if present.</li>
							<li>fix: also create .app/.sh/.cmd files when creating a new profile from existing measurement data.</li>
							<li>fix: restore advanced gamut mapping options to default if selecting a profile which does not contain those settings.</li>
							<li>fix: allow free selection of source and target viewing conditions in advanced gamut mapping options for <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym> profiles regardless of source profile type.</li>
							<li>fix: if the screen or instrument that was selected in a previous session is not available, select an available one.</li>
							<li>fix: (Mac) the “enable spyder 2” menu item would not allow to select files other than “setup.exe”.</li>
							<li>fix: [src] (Mac) if dispcalGUI was installed as application and then run from (separate) source, multiple copies were launched at certain occasions.</li>
							<li>fix: selecting a different Argyll binary directory than the previous one now actually works.</li>
							<li>chg: the previously empty entry at the top of the settings dropdown (settings which are not associated to a profile or .cal file) is now named “&lt;current settings&gt;”.</li>
							<li>chg: changed settings which are associated to a profile or .cal file are now marked with a leading asterisk in the settings dropdown.</li>
							<li>chg: default to a gamma of 2.4 (Argyll default).</li>
							<li>chg: warn before changed settings are discarded.</li>
							<li>chg: new default profile naming scheme.</li>
							<li>chg: new default file locations on all platforms.<br />
							- On Linux, dispcalGUI now adheres to the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>—the configuration file is saved as <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dispcalGUI/dispcalGUI.ini</code> ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config if not set), all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI/storage/</code> ($XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to ~/.local/share if not set) by default, and logfiles into <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI/logs/</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the file <code>~/.dispcalGUI</code> and may be safely deleted after using v0.2.5b or newer for the first time.<br />
							- On Mac OS, the configuration is saved as <code>~/Library/Preferences/dispcalGUI/dispcalGUI.ini</code>, all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>~/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI/storage/</code> by default, and logfiles into <code>~/Library/Logs/dispcalGUI/</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the file <code>~/Library/Preferences/dispcalGUI Preferences</code> and may be safely deleted after using v0.2.5b or newer for the first time.<br />
							- On Windows, the configuration file is saved as <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\dispcalGUI.ini</code>, all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\storage\</code> by default, and logfiles into <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\logs\</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\dispcalGUI</code>.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] (Windows) removed MS Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable DLLs from the source package. Users who build under Windows will have them anyway as they are installed with Python 2.6, so they are now copied directly from %SystemRoot%\WinSxS (Windows side-by-side assemblies) if possible.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] <a href="http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/sendkeys/">SendKeys</a> is now a dependency on Windows when running or building from source.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] made dispcalGUI a distutils package, so it can be built/installed via setup.py.</li>
							<li>chg: default locations are now also searched for resource files (<code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI</code>, <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS/dispcalGUI</code> on Linux, <code>~/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI</code>, <code>/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI</code> on Mac OS X, <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI</code>, <code>%COMMONAPPDATA%\dispcalGUI</code> and <code>%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\dispcalGUI</code> on Windows) in addition to the current working directory (which is always searched first if it differs from the executable directory) and the executable directory (which is always searched last).</li>
							<li>chg: better error handling. For unhandled exceptions, a message box is shown and an entry is written to the logfile.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) the calibration loader will no longer try and handle gnome-screensaver quirks—it was working too unreliably, and should really be fixed in gnome-screensaver. The current recommendation is to not use a screensaver at all if possible, and instead rely on the system's energy saving options.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) there's no longer an installer for the Linux version.</li>
							<li>chg: cancelling of certain operations like profile calculation and testchart generation is now also supported when using Python 2.5</li>
							<li>chg: when searching for Argyll executables, also search for files with “argyll-” prefix or “-argyll” suffix (thanks to Mark Whitis for report).</li>
							<li>chg: disable measurement mode selection when using a spectrometer.</li>
							<li>add: logging (also see the change related to file-storage). Logfiles are created per-date. A maximum of 5 old ones is being kept as backup.</li>
							<li>add: placeholders like display name, measurement device, whitepoint etc. can now be used in the profile name.</li>
							<li>add: unattended calibration and profiling for some instruments, meaning it is no longer necessary to press a key after calibration to start the measurements for profiling (needs xautomation under Linux).</li>
							<li>add: settings and related files can be deleted.</li>
							<li>add: (Linux, Mac, Vista) profile install scope can be selected (note: local system scope install is broken with current Argyll versions under Linux).</li>
							<li>add: version and translation information in the about window.</li>
							<li>add: projector mode when using Argyll 1.1.0 Beta or newer with the X-Rite ColorMunki.</li>

							<li>fix: video card gamma table access check always returned false when no display profile was set.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) dispcalGUI now uses the autostart specification from freedesktop.org for the profile loader under Linux when installing profiles. NOTE for users: This also means you should manually remove any autostarts from previous versions, e.g.<br/>
							<code>rm ~/.gnome2/dispwin-*.sh<br/>
							rm ~/.kde/Autostart/dispwin-*.sh</code><br/>
							and then re-install your current profile so the new loader is created. The new loader will be created in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart/ (if set) or ~/.config/autostart/ (if not set), with the filename dispcalGUI-Calibration-Loader-Display-<strong>x</strong>.desktop, where <strong>x</strong> is the display number.</li>
							<li>chg: the calibration loader will check if gnome-screensaver is running and if so, exit it before loading the calibration, then start it again to prevent resetting the calibration when activated.</li>

							<li>chg: testchart selector is now a dropdown box, shows all testchart files in chosen directory plus the default testcharts.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] new and improved build system.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] Python 2.6 is now the recommended version to run and/or build dispcalGUI. Python 2.5 is still supported, but you will not be able to cancel profile or testchart creation through the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[4]</a></sup></acronym>.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) externally installed wxGTK is no longer a dependency for executables.</li>
							<li>chg: [build] Executables are now completely self-contained. The following paths are searched for additional language files: <code>&lt;user home directory&gt;/dispcalGUI/lang</code>, <code>&lt;dispcalGUI root directory&gt;/lang</code></li>
							<li>add: all settings now stored in profile whenever possible.</li>
							<li>add: “Install” button next to settings dropdown to install selected profile.</li>
							<li>add: dropdown to choose the display to use for video card gamma table access if all of the following applies:<br />
								- more than one display connected<br />
								- one of those displays seems to have non-working video card gamma table access (detected on startup)<br />
								- one of those displays seems to have working video card gamma table access (detected on startup)</li>
							<li>add: show patch count of selected testchart next to dropdown.</li>
							<li>add: ability to select an icc profile (if it contains appropriate data) or measurement data file (.ti3) as testchart (converted on-the-fly).</li>
							<li>add: testchart generator with editing cabability (experimental)<br />
								- to select patches, click and drag the mouse over table cells, or hold SHIFT (select range) or CTRL/CMD (add/remove single cells/rows to/from selection)<br />
								- to add a patch, double-click a row label<br />

							<li>add: advanced gamut mapping options for <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>-type profiles, can also be used to overcome an apparent Photoshop CS3 bug under Mac OS X where the brush cursor shows strange artifacts when using <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></acronym>-profiles with only one intent (thanks to Klaus Karcher for reporting this).</li>
							<li>add: ability to generate profile from existing measurement data, even from an existing profile (if it contains appropriate data).</li>
							<li>add: drag and drop calibration files (.cal), profiles (.icc/.icm), testcharts (.ti1) and measurement data files (.ti3) to the main window to process/select them (does not work very reliably on Mac OS X depending on where you drop the files, and you also get no optical feedback during the drag operation like the changed mouse cursor on Linux/Windows. Your best bet when dropping any files is perhaps the unoccupied area below “Settings”).</li>
							<li>add: fully movable/resizable measurement window.</li>
