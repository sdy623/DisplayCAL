			<h2>About</h2>		
			
			<p>dispcalGUI is a <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> frontend for several utilities from the open source 
			color management system <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a> by Graeme Gill, specifically 
			dispcal, dispread, colprof and dispwin, which when used together allow you to calibrate and 
			profile your display using a measurement device. Of course, you can do a lot 
			more with Argyll CMS, but this is not the scope of this document—refer to the 
			<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ArgyllDoc.html">Argyll CMS documentation</a> for in-depth information and usage scenarios.<br />
			dispcalGUI opens two windows when run, a terminal and the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym>. The terminal is used for status messages and keyboard input during calibration. The <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> is used to set options and access functionality.</p>

			<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		
			<div id="argyll">
				<h3>Argyll CMS</h3>
			
				<p>To use dispcalGUI, you need to download and install <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a> (&gt;= v1.0.0).</p>
				<p>If you do not know Argyll CMS yet, be sure to look at the 
				<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ArgyllDoc.html">documentation</a>, specifically 
				the <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/instruments.html">list of supported 
				instruments</a> and <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing.html">installation 
				instructions</a> (also, please pay attention to the installation instructions for your measurement device).</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="prerequisites-unattended">
				<h3>Additional prerequisites for unattended calibration and profiling</h3>
				
				<p>Normally, the Argyll command line utilities require keyboard input before any measurements. Starting from dispcalGUI v0.2.5b, when using an instrument that is supported by the new unattended feature (see below), it is no longer necessary to press a key after calibration to start the measurements for profiling. Under Linux, <a href="http://hoopajoo.net/projects/xautomation.html">xautomation</a> is needed to simulate keyboard input.

				<p>Starting with dispcalGUI 0.2.5b, you can use standard distutils/setuptools commands with setup.py to build, install, and create packages. <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> will compile the extension modules and do a standard installation. Run <code>python setup.py --help</code> or <code>python setup.py --help-commands</code> for more information. A few additional commands and options which are not part of distutils or setuptools (and thus do not appear in the help) are also available:</p>
				
				<h4>Additional setup commands</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt>bdist_appdmg (Mac OS X only)</dt>
						<dd>Creates a DMG of a previously created (by the py2app or bdist_standalone commands) application bundle.</dd>
					<dt>bdist_deb (Linux/Debian-based)</dt>
						<dd>Create an installable Debian (.deb) package, much like the standard distutils command bdist_rpm for RPM packages. Prerequisites:
						You first need to install alien and rpmdb, create a dummy RPM database via <code>sudo rpmdb --initdb</code>, then edit (or create from scratch) the setup.cfg (you can have a look at misc/setup.ubuntu9.cfg for a working example).</dd>
					<dt>bdist_pyi (Linux or Windows)</dt>
						<dd>Uses pyinstaller to create a standalone executable. It has the ability to generate single-file executables (by specifying the -F option) which do not need to be shipped with external files. The drawback is a longer startup time, because the files are extracted to a temporary directory at runtime. Normally, you want to use bdist_standalone instead.</dd>
					<dt>bdist_standalone</dt>
						<dd>Creates a standalone executable that does not require a Python installation. Uses bbfreeze on Linux, py2app on Mac OS X and py2exe on Windows. setup.py will try and automatically download/install these packages for you if they are not yet installed and if not using the --use-distutils switch. Note: On Mac OS X, py2app is not able to access files inside python “egg” files (which are basically zip-compressed folders). Setuptools, which is needed by py2app, will normally be installed in “egg” form, thus preventing py2app from accessing its contents. To fix this, you need to remove any installed setuptools-&lt;version&gt;-py&lt;python-version&gt;.egg files from your Python installation's site-packages directory (normally found under <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib</code>). Then, run <code>sudo python util/ez_setup.py -Z setuptools</code> which will install setuptools unpacked, thus allowing py2app to acces all its files.</dd>
					<dt>inno (Windows only)</dt>
						<dd>Creates an Inno Setup install script for an executable created with the py2exe or bdist_standalone commands.</dd>
					<dt>purge</dt>
						<dd>Removes the <code>build</code>, <code>dispcalGUI.egg-info</code> and <code>pyinstaller/bincache*</code> directories and their contents.</dd>
					<dt>purge_dist</dt>
						<dd>Removes the <code>dist</code> directory and its contents.</dd>
					<dt>readme</dt>
						<dd>Creates README.html by parsing misc/README.template.html and substituting placeholders like date and version numbers.</dd>
					<dt>uninstall</dt>
						<dd>Uninstalls the package. You can specify the same options as for the <code>install</code> command.</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<h4>Additional setup options</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt>--cfg=&lt;name&gt;</dt>
						<dd>Use an alternate setup.cfg, e.g. tailored for a given Linux distribution. The original setup.cfg is backed up and restored afterwards. The alternate file must exist as misc/setup.&lt;name&gt;.cfg</dd>
					<dt>-n, --dry-run</dt>
						<dd>Don't actually do anything. Useful in combination with the uninstall command to see which files would be removed.</dd>
					<dt>--use-distutils</dt>
						<dd>Force setup to use distutils instead of setuptools. This is useful in combination with the bdist* commands, because it will avoid an artificial dependency on setuptools. This is actually a switch, use it once and the choice is remembered until you specify the <code>--use-setuptools</code> switch (see next paragraph).</dd>
					<dt>--use-setuptools</dt>
						<dd>Force setup to try and use setuptools instead of distutils (default). This is actually a switch, use it once and the choice is remembered until you specify the <code>--use-distutils</code> switch (see above).</dd>

			<h2>Basic concept of display calibration and profiling</h2>
		
			<p>If you have previous experience, skip to <a href="#usage">Usage</a>. If you are new to display 
			calibration, here is a quick outline of the basic concept.</p>
			
			<p>First, the display behavior is measured and adjusted to meet 
			user-definable target characteristics, like brightness, gamma and white point. 
			This step is generally referred to as calibration. Calibration is done by 
			adjusting the monitor controls, and the output of the graphics card (via 
			calibration curves, also called <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves) to get as 
			close as possible to the chosen target.<br />
			To meet the user-defined target characteristics, it is generally advisable to 
			get as far as possible by using the monitor controls, and only thereafter by 
			manipulating the output of the graphics card via <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves, to get the best
			results.</p>
			
			<p>Second, the calibrated displays behavior is measured and an <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[7]</a></sup></acronym> profile 
			describing the response of the display is created.</p>
			
			<p>Optionally and for convenience purposes, the calibration is stored in the profile, but both 
			still need to be used together to get correct results. This can lead to some ambiguity, 
			because loading the calibration curves from the profile is generally the 
			responsibility of a third party utility or the OS (currently, the only OS that 
			applies calibration curves out-of-the-box is Mac OS X), while applications using 
			the profile to do color transforms usually rely on the calibration being already 
			loaded. Even non-color-managed applications will benefit from a loaded 
			calibration because it is stored in the graphics card—it is “global”. But the calibration alone will not yield accurate colors—only fully color-managed applications will make use of display 
			profiles and the necessary color transforms. Regrettably there are several image viewing and editing applications that 
			only implement half-baked color management by not using the system's display profile (or any display profile at all), but an internal and often unchangeable “default”
			color space like sRGB, and sending output unaltered to the display after converting to that default colorspace. If the 
			display's actual response is close to sRGB, you might get pleasing (albeit not
			accurate) results, but on displays which behave differently, for example wide-color-gamut displays, even mundane colors can 
			get a strong tendency towards neon.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="usage">
			<h2>Usage</h2>
		
			<p>Upon launching dispcalGUI, you will see two windows: A terminal and the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym>. 
			The terminal is mostly used for status information, and for the interactive part 
			of display calibration. Through the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym>, you can choose your settings. Closing
			either window will quit the application, but I strongly recommend closing the 
			<acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> window first so the cleanup routines can run. On most systems, the terminal 
			window will close automatically afterwards (if you were not running from a manually opened
			terminal to begin with).<br />
			Here's a caveat for Linux systems: Because even though this is a <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> application, it still needs a terminal window for the interactive part of display calibration. If not launched from a terminal or a .desktop shortcut with Terminal=true, it will try to find one (currently, it'll search for <code>Terminal</code>, <code>gnome-terminal</code>, <code>konsole</code> and <code>xterm</code>). If that fails, you will get a message box informing you about that. You can then either launch a terminal and run dispcalGUI from there or (preferably) create a <code>.sh</code> script or <code>.desktop</code> file to launch your desired terminal with dispcalGUI (refer to your system's documentation to find out how to do that). Also, feel free to mail me the name of your terminal application if dispcalGUI didn't detect it, so I can add it to the list of terminals that dispcalGUI will search for.</p>
			
			<div id="settingsfile">
				<h3>Settings file</h3>
				<p>Here, you can load a <code>.cal</code> or <code>.icc/.icm</code> file from a previous 
				run (the dropdown box will remember up to 15, including the presets). This will set options to 
				those stored in the file and also load
				calibration curves (if any) into the video card. If the file contains only a subset of settings, you will get a message showing which settings were loaded.</p>
				
				<p>If a calibration file or profile is loaded in this way, its name will
				show up here to indicate that the settings reflect those in the file.<br />
				Also, if a calibration is present it can be used as the base when “Just Profiling”.<br />
				The chosen settings file will stay as long as you do not change any of the 
				calibration or profiling settings, with one exception: When a <code>.cal</code> file with the same base name as the settings file
				exists in the same directory, adjusting the quality and profiling controls will not cause unloading of the settings file. This allows you to use an existing calibration with new profiling settings for “Just Profiling”, or to update an existing calibration with different quality and/or profiling settings. If you change settings in other situations, the file will get unloaded (but current settings will be retained—unloading just happens to remind you that the settings no longer match those in the file), and current display profile <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> will be restored (if present, otherwise it will reset to linear).</p>

				<p>When a calibration file is loaded or present, the “Update calibration”
				checkbox will become available, which takes less time than a calibration from scratch.
				If an <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[7]</a></sup></acronym> profile with the same base name as the settings file
				exists in the same directory, the “Update profile” checkbox
				will also be available. If you place a check in that box,
				all options and the “Calibrate &amp; profile” and “Just profile” buttons at the 
				bottom will get grayed out, but don't worry, the “Calibrate”
				button takes care of the profile in that case.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="presets">
				<h3>Predefined settings (presets)</h3>
				<p>Starting with dispcalGUI v0.2.5b, predefined settings for several use cases are selectable in the settings dropdown. I strongly recommend to NOT view these presets as the solitary “correct” settings you absolutely should use unmodified if your use case matches their description. Rather view them as starting points, from where you can work towards your own, optimized (in terms of your requirements, hardware, surroundings, and personal preference) settings.</p>
				<h4>Why has a default gamma of 2.4 been chosen for the presets?</h4>
				<p>Many displays, be it CRT or LCD type, have a default response characteristic close to a gamma of approx. 2.4 (for CRTs, this is the actual native behaviour; and LCDs typically try to mimic CRTs). A target response curve for calibration that is reasonably close to the native response of a display should help to minimize calibration artifacts like banding, because the adjustments needed to the graphics card's <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves will not be as strong as if a target response farther away from the display's native response had been chosen. Of course, you can and should change the calibration response curve to a value suitable for your own requirements. For example, you might have a display that offers hardware calibration or gamma controls, that has been internally calibrated/adjusted to a different response curve, or your display's response is simply not close to a gamma of 2.4 for other reasons.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="display_instrument">
				<h3>Choosing the display to calibrate and the measurement device</h3>
		
				<p>Those can be selected through the drop-down boxes at the top. If you launch
				dispcalGUI without an instrument connected, you can connect the device afterwards and it should show up in the 
				drop-down box after a few seconds. If this doesn't work, there's also a menu
				item “Detect displays and instruments” in the “Extra” menu,
				but normally you shouldn't need this (if you can't seem to get your instrument to appear in the dropdown, please make
				sure that Argyll recognizes your instrument before filing a bug report).</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>White point</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Allows setting the target white point locus to the equivalent of a daylight or black body spectrum of the given temperature in degrees Kelvin, or as chromaticity co-ordinates. By default the white point target will be the native white of the display, and it's color temperature and delta E to the daylight spectrum locus will be shown during monitor adjustment, and adjustments will be recommended to put the display white point directly on the Daylight locus. If a daylight color temperature is given, then this will become the target of the adjustment, and the recommended adjustments will be those needed to make the monitor white point meet the target. Typical  values might be 5000 for matching printed output, or 6500, which gives a brighter, bluer look. A white point temperature different to that native to the display may limit the maximum brightness possible.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>White level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the target brightness of white in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. If this number cannot be reached, the brightest output possible is chosen, consistent with matching the white point target. Note that many of the instruments are not particularly accurate when assessing the absolute display brightness in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. NOTE that some LCD screens behave a little strangely near their absolute white point, and may therefore exhibit odd behavior at values just below white. It may be advisable in such cases to set a brightness slightly less than the maximum such a display is capable of.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Black level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the target brightness of black in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Setting too high a value may give strange results as it interacts with trying to achieve the target “advertised” gamma curve shape. Using a black output offset of 100% tries to minimize such problems.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Tone curve / gamma</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>The target response curve gamma is normally an exponential curve (output = input<sup>gamma</sup>), and defaults to 2.4 (which is typical of a CRT type displays real response). Four pre-defined curves can be used as well: the sRGB colorspace response curve, which is an exponent curve with a straight segment at the dark end and an overall response of approximately gamma 2.2, the L* curve, which is the response of the CIE L*a*b* perceptual colorspace, the Rec. 709 video standard response curve and the SMPTE 240M video standard response curve.</p>
							
							<p>For gamma values, you can also specify wheter it should be interpreted relative, meaning the gamma value provided is used to set an actual response curve in light of the non-zero black of the actual display that has the same relative output at 50% input as the ideal gamma power curve, or absolute, which allows the actual power to be specified instead, meaning that after the actual displays non-zero black is accounted for, the response at 50% input will probably not match that of the ideal power curve with that gamma value.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Black output offset</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>Real displays do not have a zero black response, while all the target response curves do, so this has to be allowed for in some way. The default way of handling this (equivalent to 100% black output offset) is to allow for this at the output of the ideal response curve, by offsetting and scaling the output values. This defined a curve that will match the responses that many other systems provide and may be a better match to the natural response of the display, but will give a less visually even response from black. The other alternative is to offset and scale the input values into the ideal response curve so that zero input gives the actual non-zero display response. This ensures the most visually even progression from display minimum, but might be hard to achieve since it is different to the naturally response of a display. A subtlety is to provide a split between how much of the offset is accounted for as input to the ideal response curve, and how much is accounted for at the output, where the degree is 0.0 accounts for it all as input offset, and 100% accounts for all of it as output offset.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Black point correction</dt>
						<dd>						
							<p>Normally dispcal will attempt to make all colors down the neutral axis (R=G=B) have the same hue as the chosen white point. Near the black point, red, green or blue can only be added, not subtracted from zero, so the process of making the near black colors have the desired hue, will lighten them to some extent. For a device with a good contrast ratio or a black point that has nearly the same hue as the white, this is not a problem. If the device contrast ratio is not so good, and the black hue is noticeably different to that of the chosen white point (which is often the case for LCD type displays), this could have a noticeably detrimental effect on an already limited contrast ratio. Here the amount of black point hue correction can be controlled. By default a factor of 100% will be used, which is usually good for CRT and also by default a factor of 0% is used for LCD type displays, but you can override these with a custom value between 0% (no correction) to 100% (full correction). If less than full correction is chosen, then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then cross over to the native or compromise black point.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Black point correction rate</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>If the black point is not being set completely to the same hue as the white point (ie. because the factor is less than 100%), then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then blend over to the native or compromise black point that is blacker, but not of the right hue. The rate of this blend can be controlled. The default value 400, which results in a target that switches from the white point target to the black, moderately close to the black point. While this typically gives a good visual result with the target neutral hue being maintained to the point where the crossover to the black hue is not visible, it may be asking too much of some displays (typically LCD type displays), and there may be some visual effects due to inconsistent color with viewing angle. For this situation a smaller value may give a better visual result (e.g. try values of 300 or 200. A value of 100 will set a pure linear blend from white point to black point). If there is too much coloration near black, try a larger value, e.g. 600 or 800.</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Calibration quality</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>Determines how much time and effort to go to in calibrating the display. The higher the quality, the more test readings will be done, the more refinement passes will be done, the tighter will be the accuracy tolerance, and the more detailed will be the calibration of the display. The result will ultimately be limited by the accuracy of the instrument, the repeatability of the display and instrument, and the resolution of the video LUT entries and digital or analogue output (RAMDAC).</p>
						</dd>
					
					<dt>Interactive display adjustment</dt>
						<dd>Turning this off skips straight to calibration measurements instead of giving you the opportunity to alter the display's contrast, brightness and white point controls first. You will normally want to keep this checked, to be able to use the controls to get closer to the chosen target characteristics.</dd>
				</dl>
			</div>		
			
			<div id="settings_profiling">
				<h3>Profiling settings</h3>
			
				<dl>
					<dt>Testchart file</dt>
						<dd>You can choose the test patches used when profiling the display here. There are some pre-built ones in the <code>ti1</code> folder (which are automatically chosen based on display type and profile type), but you can also use and create your own using the built-in testchart editor (click on the colored patches next to the testchart file selector or choose “Edit testchart...” from the “File” menu to launch it).</dd>
						
					<dt>Profile quality</dt>
						<dd>Sets the level of effort and/or detail in the resulting profile. For table based profiles (<acronym title="Color Look Up Table">cLUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> profiles), it sets the main lookup table size, and hence quality in the resulting profile. It is highly recommended that medium quality be used as a starting point, and other settings only tried after this has been evaluated. For matrix profiles it sets the per channel curve detail level and fitting “effort”.</dd>
			
					<dt>Profile type</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Generally you can differentiate between two types of profiles: <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> based and matrix based.</p>
							
							<p>Matrix based profiles are smaller in filesize, somewhat less accurate (though in most cases smoother) compared to <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> based types, and usually have the best compatibility across <acronym title="Color Mangement Module">CMM<sup><a href="#definition_CMM">[1]</a></sup></acronym>s, applications and systems — but only support the colorimetric intent for color transforms. For matrix based profiles, the <acronym title="Profile Connection Space">PCS</acronym> is always XYZ. You can choose between using individual curves for each channel (red, green and blue), a single curve for all channels, individual gamma values for each channel or a single gamma for all channels. Curves are more accurate than gamma values. A single curve or gamma can be used if individual curves or gamma values degrade the gray balance of an otherwise good calibration.</p>
							
							<p><acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> based profiles are larger in filesize, more accurate (but may sacrifice smoothness), in some cases less compatible (applications might not be able to use or show bugs/quirks with <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> type profiles, or certain variations of them).
							When choosing a <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> based profile type, advanced gamut mapping options become available which you can use to create perceptual and/or saturation tables inside the profile in addition to the default colorimetric tables which are always created. L*a*b* or XYZ can be used as <acronym title="Profile Connection Space">PCS</acronym>, with XYZ being recommended especially for wide-gamut displays bacause their primaries might exceed the <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[7]</a></sup></acronym> L*a*b* encoding range. Under Windows, XYZ <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> types are only available in dispcalGUI if using Argyll CMS >= 1.1.0 RC4 because of a requirement for matrix tags in the profile, which are not created by prior Argyll versions. As it is hard to verify if the <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> of an combined XYZ <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> + matrix profile is actually used, you may choose to create a profile with a swapped R ↔ G matrix (which I'd recommend), so it will be obvious if an application uses it instead.</p>
							
							<p>Note: <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym>-based profiles might be confused with video card <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves, but they're two different things. Both <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym>-based and matrix-based profiles can include video card <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves.</p>

					<dt>Profile name</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>As long as you do not enter your own text here, the profile name is auto generated from the chosen calibration and profiling options. The current auto naming mechanism creates quite verbose names which are not necessarily nice to read, but they can help in identifying the profile.<br />
							Also note that the profile name is not only used for the resulting profile, but for all intermediate files as well (filename extensions are added automatically) <em>and</em> all files are stored in a folder of that name. You can choose where this folder is created by clicking the disk icon next to the field (it defaults to your system's default location for user data).<br />
							Here's an example under Linux, on other platforms some file extensions and the location of the home directory will differ (you can mouse over the filenames to get a tooltip with a short description what the file is for):</p>
								
							<p>Chosen profile save path: <code title="User home directory">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage</code><br />
							Profile name: <code>mydisplay</code></p>
							
							<p>The following folder will be created: <code>~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay</code></p>
							
							<p>During calibration &amp; profiling the following files will be created:<br />
							<code><span title="Calibrate and profile, then install profile afterwards">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.all.sh</span><br />
							<span title="Contains video LUT curves and most settings used for calibration">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.cal</span><br />
							<span title="Create a profile from the .ti3 measurement file">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.colprof.sh</span><br />
							<span title="Calibrate and create .cal file">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.dispcal.sh</span><br />
							<span title="Create a .ti3 file by measuring the .ti1 patches, first loading the .cal file">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.dispread.sh</span><br />
							<span title="Install the profile">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.dispwin.sh</span><br />
							<span title="The end result, a display profile">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.icc</span><br />
							<span title="Contains the measurement patches used to create the .ti3 measurement file">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.ti1</span><br />
							<span title="Contains the measured display response">~/.local/share/dispcalGUI/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay.ti3</span></code></p>
							
							<p>(the <code>.sh</code> files can be used to re-run without <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> but same settings from a shell)</p>

The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument should have received a copy of this firmware along with their instrument from the original vendor, as part of the instrument setup files.<br />
On Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, if the vendors drivers have been installed on the users machine, the firmware pattern can usually be located from there. If the vendors drivers have not been installed, or the user does not wish to install them, or no vendors drivers are available for the users platform (i.e. Linux), then the Spyder 2 installation CDROM will also be searched if present. If your Linux system is not running automount, or your automount is setup to mount CDROM's somewhere other than /media, /mnt/cdrom, /media/cdrom or /cdrom, then you will have to mount the CDROM manually, and select the path to the CDROM setup/setup.exe file.

			<p id="issue-win64-driversigenforcement"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under Windows Vista/7 64-bit, driver signature enforcement prevents the installation of unsigned Argyll USB drivers.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> Beginning with Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.1.0, you may use one of the following workarounds. One method is to self sign the drivers and put your system in test mode. The procedure for doing this is a little complicated though, and beyond the scope of this documentation. You might want to refer to “<a href="http://nil-techno.blogspot.com/2008/08/installing-unsigned-drivers-on-vista-64.html">installing unsigned drivers on Vista 64</a>”. If you take this path then make sure you sign the libusb0.sys and libusb0_x86.sys files in the Argyll_VX.X.X/libusbw directory <strong>before</strong> you install the device, otherwise you will have to remove &amp; delete the driver using device manager, and also manually delete the libusb0 and libusb0_x86 .sys and .dll files from Windows\system32, Windows\System32\drivers and Windows\SysWOW64 and start again.<br />
			If you don't want/can't sign the driver files or enable test mode, another workaround is to allow loading unsigned drivers by pressing F8 when the system boots, and selecting the boot option to “Disable Driver Signature Enforcement”. Note that you have to do this <strong>every time</strong> you boot and want to use the USB instruments (you may still get a warning about an unsigned driver not being loaded after plugging the instrument in, booting or installing the driver, but take these messages with a grain of salt, and check in device manager and also whether the instruments are actually accessible).</span></p>
			
			<p id="issue-win-calload"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under Windows Vista/7, the installed display profile calibration cannot be loaded.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> Open the Windows start menu, select “Control Panel”, then “Color Management”. Under the “Devices” tab, select your display device, then tick “Use my settings for this device”.</span></p>
			
			<p id="issue-win-uac"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under Windows Vista, the calibration gets unloaded when a “User Access Control” prompt is shown.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> This Windows Vista bug seems to have been fixed under Windows 7, and can be remedied under Vista by either manually reloading calibration, or disabling UAC—but please note that you sacrifice security by doing this. To manually reload the calibration, either open dispcalGUI and select “Load <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves from current display profile” in the “Extra” menu, or (quicker) open the Windows start menu and select “dispcalGUI Calibration Loader (Display &lt;number&gt;)” in the “Startup” subfolder. To disable <acronym title="User Access Control">UAC<sup><a href="#definition_UAC">[8]</a></sup></acronym> (not recommended!), open the Windows start menu and enter “msconfig” in the search box. Click on the Tools tab. Select the line “Disable UAC” and click the “Launch” button. Close msconfig. You need to reboot your system for changes to apply.</span></p>
			
			<p id="issue-win-spyder2"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under Windows, enabling the Spyder 2 colorimeter might fail when not running as administrator.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> Run dispcalGUI as admin. Right-click the executable and choose “Run as administrator...”</span></p>
			
			<p id="issue-mac-pscursor"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under Mac OS X, the brush cursor in Photoshop CS3 looks funny (box around brush).<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> This seems to be a Photoshop bug which shows with <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym>-type profiles that have only one rendering intent. You can try to overcome it by selecting “Advanced...” next to the profile type dropdown, selecting an existing <acronym title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[7]</a></sup></acronym> profile (probably the source profile you use most often) and tick at least one of the “Apply gamut mapping to” checkboxes before profiling. To do that for an existing profile, choose “Create profile from measurement data...” from the “Extra” menu. Note that this does not always solve the issue. Trying another profile type (XYZ LUT instead of L*a*b* LUT) might also help.</span></p>				
				
			<p id="issue-linux-lutaccess"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> No video LUT access under Linux/X11 (“calibrate only” and “calibrate &amp; profile” buttons grayed, “profile only” button available)<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> Please refer to <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_Linux.html">Installing the software on Linux with X11</a> and “Fixing access to Video LUTs” therein.</span></p>
			
			<div id="issue-linux-gtktheme" class="p"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Under <em>some</em> Linux distributions, with <em>some</em> GTK themes, when opening a file selector, “Gtk-Message: ...” strings appear in the terminal.<br /></span>
			<div class="a"><span>Solution:</span> These messages are generated from GTK and hint to certain unsupported features in a GTK theme file, I have no influence on them, but they can be safely ignored if the full message is something like “Gtk-Message: (for origin information, set GTK_DEBUG): failed to retrieve property `GtkTreeView::odd-row-color'”. If they really bother you and you don't mind using the shell and editing files by hand, you can get rid of these messages by changing the involved GTK theme file:
			<ol>
				<li>Open a shell and type <code>export GTK_DEBUG=1</code></li>
				<li>Run dispcalGUI and open a file selector.</li>
				<li>In the familiar message, the path to the involved theme file should now be displayed.</li>
				<li>Open that theme file in a text editor (you might need elevated rights to be able to edit it) and navigate to the line that was also shown in the message.</li>
				<li>Replace the color value so that it is no longer a function call, e.g. if the old line was:<br />
					<code>GtkTreeView::odd-row-color = shade(0.9, @base_color)</code><br />
					then change it to (look up a suitable color value in the file or specify your own):<br />
					<code>GtkTreeView::odd-row-color = "#eeeeee"</code>
				</li>
				<li>Save the theme file &amp; exit the text editor.</li>
				<li>Restart dispcalGUI and open a file selector to check if the message is gone.</li>
				<li>Open a shell and type <code>unset GTK_DEBUG</code></li>
			</ol></div></div>
			
			<p id="issue-english"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> Some text is still in english, even though another language is selected in the menu.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Remark:</span> All output from the Argyll utilities is always english, and on Mac OS X, also the menuitems in the application menu. This is not changeable by me.</span></p>
			
			<p id="issue-linux-kdeqt"><span class="q"><span>Issue:</span> The application does not look native under Linux with KDE.<br /></span>
			<span class="a"><span>Solution:</span> You need the <a href="http://gtk-qt.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">GTK-Qt Theme Engine</a> for native KDE look. Most Linux distributions offer ready-made packages through their packaging systems, search for “gtk-qt” (there will likely be separate packages for KDE3 and KDE4).</span></p>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When restoring defaults, selected display/instrument/measurement mode, language and profile name are retained.</li>
							<li>The display/instrument selector is only enabled if more than one device detected respectively.</li>
							<li>Changed i1 Pro highres measurement mode from implicit to user choice.</li>
							<li>Gamut mapping: When selecting a source profile, pre-select a source viewing condition based on profile class (monitor or printer).</li>
							<li>Updated defaults and presets to Argyll 1.1.0 values (i.e. black output offset).</li>
							<li>Short display name placeholder (%dns) for profile name should not yield single numbers or model name without model number any more (or atleast less likely).</li>
							<li>Log messages from most informational and all error dialogs.</li>
							<li>Show file paths in most dialogs involving file processing.</li>
							<li>Documentation in the ReadMe has been updated and is now more or less complete for the main application (testchart editor docs are still to be done). Setup instructions have also been streamlined.</li>
							<li>Moved information how to fix video LUT access under Linux/X11 to the “known issues and solutions” section in the ReadMe.</li>
							<li>Linux: Updated udev rules to those provided with Argyll 1.1.0. Removed obsolete permissions and policy files.</li>
							<li>Linux: In multi-display setups using separate X screens, it should no longer be necessary to launch dispcalGUI on the display you want to measure.</li>
							<li>Windows: Get names of displays via additional Windows API calls (should yield more descriptive names than “DISPLAY1”, “DISPLAY2” etc.)</li>
							<li>Windows (cosmetic): Use default command prompt text color, and a darker variant only when doing measurements.</li>
							<li>dispcalGUI version now corresponds to SVN revision number, split into its digit components. Build system (setup.py) uses SVN to generate version information.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>LUT Viewer: When no display is selected (i.e. when Argyll binaries are not found), it will now try to show the vcgt of the 1st display's profile.</li>
							<li>LUT Viewer: When hiding the viewer and loading different LUT curves, those changes were not reflected when showing the viewer again.</li>
							<li>LUT Viewer: If a profile does not contain a 'vcgt' tag, clear canvas and disable R/G/B checkboxes.</li>
							<li>Selection of display used for video LUT access not working correctly.</li>
							<li>Loading of calibration upon initial preview in profile installation dialog if profile does not contain dispcalGUI settings.</li>
							<li>Do not show failure message if user cancels profile installation via the password dialog when installing in system scope.</li>
							<li>In some cases, values read from the configuration file were not correctly validated (would only show with deliberately altered or broken config file).</li>
							<li>colprof output is no longer swallowed when creating a matrix profile with Argyll versions &lt;= 1.0.4.</li>
							<li>Linux: Fall back to ASCII if detected encoding is not UTF-8 to fix profile install issues.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: Enabling the Spyder 2 colorimeter might need elevated privileges.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: When installing a profile in local system scope, the necessary password was not accepted under newer Linux distros and also Mac OS X &gt; 10.4.11</li>
							<li>Mac OS X (cosmetic): Suppress spurious AppleScript messages.</li>
							<li>Windows: Get display profile via registry instead of Windows API because the latter does not reflect runtime changes to profile associations (you still need to refresh the LUT Viewer when changing profile associations <em>outside</em> of dispcalGUI while it is running).</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Known issues in this release:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: You can't interact with the drop-down menu or the checkboxes in the LUT Viewer while a profile installation dialog is shown.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
				
				<dt>2009-07-16</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed a glitch in the Linux Autopackage installer where it would install even if required libraries were missing.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
				
				<dt>2009-06-30 0.2.6b3 (SVN r239)</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>fix (Windows): Fixed a critical bug in the Windows codepath which tried to access non-existent paths when certain settings were used.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					
				<dt>2009-06-26 0.2.6b2</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>fix: Only look at &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt; during the Python version check (fixes a critical error on Ubuntu 9.10 Beta, where the Python revision number has an unexpected value).</li>
							<li>fix: The <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> Viewer is now also able to plot curves from *.cal files.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux): If launched on an X display which is not the first display, the measurement window's location no longer determines the display which is used for measurements. This allows non-Xinerama multiscreen configurations to work with dispcalGUI. Note: You need to launch dispcalGUI on the display you want to measure, e.g. <code>`DISPLAY=:0.1 dispcalGUI`</code>.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux): Get the profile from the correct display when loading a display's <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves into the <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> Viewer.</li>
							<li>fix (Linux, cosmetic): Suppress CUPS warnings encountered on some systems when using the <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> Viewer.</li>
							<li>fix (Mac OS X): Do not offer 'Network' scope during profile installation if <code>/Network/Library/ColorSync/Profiles</code> does not exist.</li>
							<li>fix (Windows, cosmetic): Made sure the message "Debug: src/helpers.cpp(140): 'CreateActCtx' failed with error 0x0000007b (the filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.)" is not shown when launching the standalone Windows executable, by changing the way *.pyd files are bundled (they are now copied to the executable's directory and are no longer part of the executable itself).</li>
							<li>chg: The <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> Viewer resets to linear if a display without associated profile is selected.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
				
				<dt>2009-06-22 0.2.6b</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>fix: calibration preview checkbox in the “install profile” dialog should now correctly toggle between previous and new calibration.</li>
							<li>fix: profiling failed when creating a profile on top of an existing calibration.</li>
							<li>fix: correctly decode environment variables (should fix a failure when trying to create a profile and the username contains non-ASCII characters).</li>
							<li>fix: automatic restoration of defaults before loading settings from a profile or cal file should no longer restore “do not show again” dialogs.</li>
							<li>fix (Windows): several errors related to character encoding.</li>
							<li>chg: unattended calibration and profiling: wait 10 seconds instead of 5 after calibration before trying to start profiling measurements (some instruments seem to need longer to initialize than others, e.g. Spyder 2).</li>
							<li>chg (Python packages and source): instead of requiring wxPython 2.8.x specifically, only ensure a minimal version of 2.8.</li>
							<li>add: <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> viewer.</li>
						</ul>

							<li>Added Linux Autopackage download.</li>
							<li>Renamed 55-Argyll.rules to 92-Argyll.rules, so it can work on Debian too.</li>

							<li>fix: “TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, instance found” when calling any of the get*Description() methods of an ICCProfile instance, which caused profile creation from existing profile to fail.</li>
							<li>fix: (Windows Vista) application exit on launch if autostart directory did not exist.</li>
							<li>fix: (source, Debian and RPM packages) use the correct wxPython version</li>
							<li>fix: tab-key traversal of calibration settings controls.</li>
							<li>fix: automatically scroll into view focused calibration settings controls if scrollbars are shown.</li>
							<li>fix: properly clean &amp; remove temporary directory.</li>
							<li>fix: (cosmetic) added some padding to calibration settings right-hand side so scrollbar won't overlap if shown.</li>
							<li>chg: (cosmetic) enable auto-sizing (fit to contents) for colortemp locus, trc type and profile type selectors.</li>
							<li>chg: (cosmetic) do not show vendor name in instrument select dropdown (conserve some space).</li>
							<li>chg: (cosmetic) made the instrument selector a little narrower (needs less space now to display instrument name because the vendor name is stripped) and the measure mode selector a bit wider (to accommodate for projector mode).</li>
							<li>chg: only try to re-start within terminal if running as standalone executable.</li>
							<li>chg: show application restart request in the chosen language after changing it.</li>
							<li>chg: allow resizing/maximizing of main window (a minimal size is forced to prevent layout glitches).</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) install from source or package will try to automatically setup access to your instrument. Some services (PolicyKit/HAL or udev) may need to be restarted to get the updated configuration recognized. If in doubt, a reboot should work in all cases.</li>
							<li>add: french translation (by Loïc Guégant, thanks!)</li>

							<li>fix: (Windows) several actions unexpectedly failing under Windows 7 (dispcalGUI created temporary files via system calls on several occasions, but on Windows, this does not create the file in the user's temp directory as one would expect, but in the ROOT directory e.g. C:\ - a sane method is now being used instead).</li>
							<li>fix: bug in sorting function caused leading and trailing zeroes of numbers in testchart filenames to get lost, thus failing to load such files.</li>
							<li>fix: (Linux) “No module named _md5” error with the standalone executable on some Linux distros (apparently an OpenSSL-related issue, because normally it wouldn't fall back to the legacy _md5 module which is not even built by default in recent Python versions). The fallback _md5 module is now included.</li>
							<li>fix: calibration was not automatically added &amp; selected in the dropdown menu when only calibrating.</li>
							<li>fix: dropping a profile which was not created in dispcalGUI onto the application window no longer results in an unhandled error.</li>
							<li>fix: when trying to load <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> curves from a profile which actually does not contain any, an error message is now shown instead of resetting the <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> to linear and erroneously stating the curves were succesfully loaded.</li>
							<li>fix: add display device name as device model description when profiling.</li>
							<li>fix: when creating a new profile from an existing profile, use that profile's device model description if present.</li>
							<li>fix: also create .app/.sh/.cmd files when creating a new profile from existing measurement data.</li>
							<li>fix: restore advanced gamut mapping options to default if selecting a profile which does not contain those settings.</li>
							<li>fix: allow free selection of source and target viewing conditions in advanced gamut mapping options for <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> profiles regardless of source profile type.</li>
							<li>fix: if the screen or instrument that was selected in a previous session is not available, select an available one.</li>
							<li>fix: (Mac) the “enable spyder 2” menu item would not allow to select files other than “setup.exe”.</li>
							<li>fix: [src] (Mac) if dispcalGUI was installed as application and then run from (separate) source, multiple copies were launched at certain occasions.</li>
							<li>fix: selecting a different Argyll binary directory than the previous one now actually works.</li>
							<li>chg: the previously empty entry at the top of the settings dropdown (settings which are not associated to a profile or .cal file) is now named “&lt;current settings&gt;”.</li>
							<li>chg: changed settings which are associated to a profile or .cal file are now marked with a leading asterisk in the settings dropdown.</li>
							<li>chg: default to a gamma of 2.4 (Argyll default).</li>
							<li>chg: warn before changed settings are discarded.</li>
							<li>chg: new default profile naming scheme.</li>
							<li>chg: new default file locations on all platforms.<br />
							- On Linux, dispcalGUI now adheres to the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>—the configuration file is saved as <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dispcalGUI/dispcalGUI.ini</code> ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config if not set), all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI/storage/</code> ($XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to ~/.local/share if not set) by default, and logfiles into <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI/logs/</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the file <code>~/.dispcalGUI</code> and may be safely deleted after using v0.2.5b or newer for the first time.<br />
							- On Mac OS, the configuration is saved as <code>~/Library/Preferences/dispcalGUI/dispcalGUI.ini</code>, all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>~/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI/storage/</code> by default, and logfiles into <code>~/Library/Logs/dispcalGUI/</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the file <code>~/Library/Preferences/dispcalGUI Preferences</code> and may be safely deleted after using v0.2.5b or newer for the first time.<br />
							- On Windows, the configuration file is saved as <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\dispcalGUI.ini</code>, all files created during calibration/profiling go into <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\storage\</code> by default, and logfiles into <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI\logs\</code><br />
							Any old (pre v0.2.5b) configuration data is retained in the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\dispcalGUI</code>.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] (Windows) removed MS Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable DLLs from the source package. Users who build under Windows will have them anyway as they are installed with Python 2.6, so they are now copied directly from %SystemRoot%\WinSxS (Windows side-by-side assemblies) if possible.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] <a href="http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/sendkeys/">SendKeys</a> is now a dependency on Windows when running or building from source.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] made dispcalGUI a distutils package, so it can be built/installed via setup.py.</li>
							<li>chg: default locations are now also searched for resource files (<code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispcalGUI</code>, <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS/dispcalGUI</code> on Linux, <code>~/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI</code>, <code>/Library/Application Support/dispcalGUI</code> on Mac OS X, <code>%APPDATA%\dispcalGUI</code>, <code>%COMMONAPPDATA%\dispcalGUI</code> and <code>%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\dispcalGUI</code> on Windows) in addition to the current working directory (which is always searched first if it differs from the executable directory) and the executable directory (which is always searched last).</li>
							<li>chg: better error handling. For unhandled exceptions, a message box is shown and an entry is written to the logfile.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) the calibration loader will no longer try and handle gnome-screensaver quirks - it was working too unreliably, and should really be fixed in gnome-screensaver. The current recommendation is to not use a screensaver at all if possible, and instead rely on the system's energy saving options.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) there's no longer an installer for the Linux version.</li>
							<li>chg: cancelling of certain operations like profile calculation and testchart generation is now also supported when using Python 2.5</li>
							<li>chg: when searching for Argyll executables, also search for files with “argyll-” prefix or “-argyll” suffix (thanks to Mark Whitis for report).</li>
							<li>chg: disable measurement mode selection when using a spectrometer.</li>
							<li>add: logging (also see the change related to file-storage). Logfiles are created per-date. A maximum of 5 old ones is being kept as backup.</li>
							<li>add: placeholders like display name, measurement device, whitepoint etc. can now be used in the profile name.</li>
							<li>add: unattended calibration and profiling for some instruments, meaning it is no longer necessary to press a key after calibration to start the measurements for profiling (needs xautomation under Linux).</li>
							<li>add: settings and related files can be deleted.</li>
							<li>add: (Linux, Mac, Vista) profile install scope can be selected (note: local system scope install is broken with current Argyll versions under Linux).</li>
							<li>add: version and translation information in the about window.</li>
							<li>add: projector mode when using Argyll 1.1.0 Beta or newer with the X-Rite ColorMunki.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>fix: video <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> access check always returned false when no display profile was set.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) dispcalGUI now uses the autostart specification from freedesktop.org for the profile loader under Linux when installing profiles. NOTE for users: This also means you should manually remove any autostarts from previous versions, e.g.<br/>
							<code>rm ~/.gnome2/dispwin-*.sh<br/>
							rm ~/.kde/Autostart/dispwin-*.sh</code><br/>
							and then re-install your current profile so the new loader is created. The new loader will be created in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart/ (if set) or ~/.config/autostart/ (if not set), with the filename dispcalGUI-Calibration-Loader-Display-<strong>x</strong>.desktop, where <strong>x</strong> is the display number.</li>
							<li>chg: the calibration loader will check if gnome-screensaver is running and if so, exit it before loading the calibration, then start it again to prevent resetting the calibration when activated.</li>
							<li>chg: .sh/.cmd file in profile folder is no longer created when just installing a profile.</li>
							<li>add: message box when selecting <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> as profile type with recommendation to use more samples for higher quality profiles.</li>
							<li>add: default to english locale if translation doesn't exist.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>fix: no longer possible to introduce invalid value types through a malformed config file (which could lead to dispcalGUI not launching).</li>
							<li>fix: windows can no longer be moved permanently out of the visible screen area.</li>
							<li>fix: spaces and special chars in the profile name should work now (should have from the start, but I had some superfluous code which broke it).</li>
							<li>fix: spaces in the path to dispcalGUI should work now under Linux and Mac OS X too (Windows had no problem)</li>
							<li>fix: measurement file no longer gets deleted after successful measurement if profile generation fails (was a simple oversight on my side).</li>
							<li>fix: [cosmetic] logo header now always spans the whole width of the window.</li>
							<li>fix: [cosmetic] (Mac OS X) on first launch, a second, unused, terminal window is no longer opened.</li>
							<li>fix: windows will now try to adjust its height to fit on small screens (scrollbars might appear).</li>
							<li>chg: “Calibration file” renamed to “Settings” and moved to the top, is now a dropdown box remembering the last 10 used files. Settings are stored in and loaded from profiles.</li>
							<li>chg: renamed “Display type” to “Measurement mode” and moved over to measurement device selector.</li>
							<li>chg: default to “LCD” for measurement mode.</li>
							<li>chg: default testchart file names are now localized.</li>
							<li>chg: new default testcharts, four flavours: matrix default (91 patches), <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> default (127 patches), large (512 patches) and massive (3012 patches).</li>
							<li>chg: testchart selector is now a dropdown box, shows all testchart files in chosen directory plus the default testcharts.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] new and improved build system.</li>
							<li>chg: [build/src] Python 2.6 is now the recommended version to run and/or build dispcalGUI. Python 2.5 is still supported, but you will not be able to cancel profile or testchart creation through the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym>.</li>
							<li>chg: (Linux) externally installed wxGTK is no longer a dependency for executables.</li>
							<li>chg: [build] Executables are now completely self-contained. The following paths are searched for additional language files: <code>&lt;user home directory&gt;/dispcalGUI/lang</code>, <code>&lt;dispcalGUI root directory&gt;/lang</code></li>
							<li>add: all settings now stored in profile whenever possible.</li>
							<li>add: “Install” button next to settings dropdown to install selected profile.</li>
							<li>add: dropdown to choose the display to use for <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> access if all of the following applies:<br />
								- more than one display connected<br />
								- one of those displays seems to have non-working <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> access (detected on startup)<br />
								- one of those displays seems to have working <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym> access (detected on startup)</li>
							<li>add: show patch count of selected testchart next to dropdown.</li>
							<li>add: ability to select an icc profile (if it contains appropriate data) or measurement data file (.ti3) as testchart (converted on-the-fly).</li>
							<li>add: testchart generator with editing cabability (experimental)<br />
								- to select patches, click and drag the mouse over table cells, or hold SHIFT (select range) or CTRL/CMD (add/remove single cells/rows to/from selection)<br />
								- to add a patch, double-click a row label<br />
								- to delete patches, select them, then hold CTRL or CMD and hit DEL or BACKSPACE (will always delete whole rows even if only single cells selected)<br />
								- CTRL-C/CTRL-V/CTRL-A = copy/paste/select all</li>
							<li>add: advanced gamut mapping options for <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym>-type profiles, can also be used to overcome an apparent Photoshop CS3 bug under Mac OS X where the brush cursor shows strange artifacts when using <acronym title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[2]</a></sup></acronym>-profiles with only one intent (thanks to Klaus Karcher for reporting this).</li>
							<li>add: ability to generate profile from existing measurement data, even from an existing profile (if it contains appropriate data).</li>
							<li>add: drag and drop calibration files (.cal), profiles (.icc/.icm), testcharts (.ti1) and measurement data files (.ti3) to the main window to process/select them (does not work very reliably on Mac OS X depending on where you drop the files, and you also get no optical feedback during the drag operation like the changed mouse cursor on Linux/Windows. Your best bet when dropping any files is perhaps the unoccupied area below “Settings”).</li>
							<li>add: fully movable/resizable measurement window.</li>
							<li>add: profile and testchart creation can be aborted (when running from source only if using Python >= 2.6).</li>
							<li>add: “Before” / “After” switch when calibration / profiling complete.</li>
							<li>add: menu item to enable Spyder 2 from within dispcalGUI.</li>
							<li>add: italian and spanish <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<sup><a href="#definition_GUI">[3]</a></sup></acronym> translations (thanks contributors!)</li>
