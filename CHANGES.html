							<li>Mac OS X: Set default profile type to single curve + matrix with black point compensation due to long-standing Mac OS X bugs with any other profile type.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label moderate"><span>[</span>Moderate<span>]</span></span> Unhandled exception and UI freeze when the 3D LUT format was set to madVR and there never was a prior version of ArgyllCMS on the system or the previous version was older than or equal to 1.6.3 during that same DisplayCAL session, due to a missing capability check.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label moderate"><span>[</span>Moderate<span>]</span></span> Division by zero when trying to create a SMPTE 2084 HDR 3D LUT if the profile black level was zero (regression of a change in DisplayCAL 3.4, SVN revision r4896).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> If using the alternate forward profiler and the profile type was XYZ LUT + swapped matrix, the swapped matrix was overwritten with an accurate one (regression introduced in DisplayCAL 3.3.4, SVN revision r4736).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> It was not possible to run a measurement report with a simulation profile set as display profile, but no profile assigned to the actual display.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Rec. 1886 measurement report with originally non Rec. 709 tone response profile: Make sure to override the original tone response of the profile so Rec. 1886 gives the expected result.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> If a measurement report HTML file was mangled by another application that removed the XML self-closing tags forward slashes, it was not possible to correctly update the report using “Update measurement or uniformity report” from the “Tools” menu.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> If using a pattern generator, check it is valid before binding a disconnect-on-close event when using the visual whitepoint editor. Prevents an attribute error when using the visual whitepoint editor and the madTPG network implementation (i.e. under Mac OS X).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Windows: Always use the active display device directly when querying or setting profiles instead of mimicking applications using the Windows GetICMProfile API (fixes getting the correct profile with display configurations consisting of three or more displays where some of them are deactivated).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Check whether or not a display device is attached to multiple adapters and disable fixing profile associations in that case.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Work-around hitching caused by Windows WcsGetDefaultColorProfile API call on some systems.</li>

						<h3>DisplayCAL 3.4 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> HDR Hybrid Log-Gamma transfer function option for 3D LUTs.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> HDR verification testcharts.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> Simplified chinese translation thanks to 林泽帆(Xpesir).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Linux: wxPython Phoenix 4.0.0b/rc1 compatibility.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Notifications (for 3rd party calibration/profiling software and user-defined exceptions) can be turned off.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> HDR 3D LUTs: SMPTE 2084 with roll-off now allows specifying the mastering display minimum and peak luminance which are used to adjust the roll-off start and clipping points (BT.2390-3).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> HDR 3D LUTs: Chroma compression is now done in Lpt color space, providing improved preservation of detail in compressed highlights.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> 
							Do not disable the measurement report button if the selected setting is a preset and a simulation profile is used as display profile with tone curve set to “Unchanged” (i.e. do not require selecting “&lt;Current&gt;” under settings to allow verifying the native device response against a selected simulation profile).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Limit profile name length taking into account the full path of the final storage directory.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Disable automatic output levels detection for colorimeter correction creation measurements.</li>
							<li>Changed the “Softproof” and “Video” presets to no longer intentionally swap red and green for the fallback matrix.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> <span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> Minor UI consistency changes.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Linux: X11 root window _ICC_PROFILE_xxx atom enumeration for Xrandr now matches the Xinerama order, so that _ICC_PROFILE_xxx atoms match irrespective of which extension applications are using. This improves conformance to the <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php%3Ftitle=ICC_Profiles_in_X_Specification_0.4.html">ICC Profiles in X Specification</a> and matches the respective change in ArgyllCMS 2.0.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X (standalone application): No longer support OS X versions prior to 10.6. This streamlines and slims the application bundle and allows using more recent 3rd party dependencies which are not available for older Mac OS X releases. If you still need support for Mac OS X 10.5, use the 0install version of DisplayCAL.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label critical"><span>[</span>Critical<span>]</span></span> Ensure alternate forward profiler device to PCS table input curves are strictly monotonically increasing to prevent clipping resulting in peaks in the response in case of bad underlying (non-monotonic) device behavior (regression of a change in DisplayCAL 3.3.5, SVN revision r4838).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Always force the first entry in PCS to device table input curves to zero when generating high resolution PCS to device tables (fixes potential unexpected non-zero RGB output for zero input to perceptual PCS to device table).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> <span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> When not confirming a manual DisplayCAL update but ArgyllCMS is up to date, reflect this in the final dialog message.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label trivial"><span>[</span>Trivial<span>]</span></span> ReShade 3D LUT: If ReShade 3.x default shaders are installed, write the different parts of the 3D LUT to the correct respective sub-directories and no longer write the superfluous ReShade.fx.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> <span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> Linux: Prevent flickering of tab buttons on some systems when switching tabs.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label moderate"><span>[</span>Moderate<span>]</span></span> Linux: The way display device enumeration was performed was not always guaranteed to give consistent results across the different available external device to profile mapping APIs, which could lead to wrong profile associations in multi-display configurations (this fix is required to match how ArgyllCMS 2.0 enumerates displays).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Mac OS X (standalone application): Bundle certificate authority certificates to enable verifying server certificates (fixes not being able to automatically download updates).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Windows: When creating a colorimeter correction from measurement file(s) stored in a path where one or more components(s) started with a number from 1-9 or the lowercase letter <code>g</code>, the operation failed and the created colorimeter correction had to be retrieved from the temporary directory manually.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): When manually disabling calibration loading via the pop-up menu, and then starting DisplayCAL (or another application detected by the profile loader) and closing it again, the profile loader would stay disabled, including the calibration loading related menu items, requiring a profile loader restart.</li>

						<h3>DisplayCAL 3.3.5 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Updated french localization (thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> When generating high resolution PCS to device tables for XYZ LUT profiles, round PCS candidate “fit” so a good match is not potentially needlessly discarded in favor of a match with lower effective usage of the available lookup table grid points (may speed up the process as well).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Use single curve detection based on calibration accuracy for shaper tags of XYZ LUT profiles as well.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> When enabling the Spyder2, check if the spyd2PLD.bin firmware has actually been successfully extracted (taking into account the install scope) and fall back to alternate methods when using automatic mode if the firmware cannot be extracted from the vendor software present in the local filesystem (fixes inability to enable the Spyder2 under Mac OS X if the vendor software is installed).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Windows: Make measurement report filename safe for filesystem encoding (works around encoding quirks with certain locales).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Windows: Windows silently strips any combination of trailing spaces and dots in file and folder names, so do the same for the profile name.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): WCS can return no profile without error in some situations, but the no error case wasn't accounted for, resulting in an unhandled exception in that case.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Get the process identifier before enumerating windows to prevent an unhandled exception if a madVR instance is already running before starting the profile loader.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Detect if the current display profile video card gamma table tag contains linear calibration when checking if madVR did reset the video card gamma table to linear to prevent the profile loader alternating between enabled and disabled state if using windowed overlay in madVR.</li>

							<li><span class="changelog-label moderate"><span>[</span>Moderate<span>]</span></span> Linux (profile installation and profile loading): Getting the fallback XrandR display device ID could unexpectedly return no result in some cases due to incorrect parsing, leading to potential application of a stale device to profile mapping or no profile at all (regression of a change in DisplayCAL 3.3.4, SVN revision r4800).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label minor"><span>[</span>Minor<span>]</span></span> Linux, Mac OS X: The visual whitepoint editor was failing to update the test pattern area of a connected madTPG instance when madVR was selected as display device, due to an implementation bug related to setting the background color.</li>

							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Use an alternate way to generate the matrix for profiles created from the small testchart for matrix profiles (may improve accuracy on very linear displays) and use an optimized tone response curve if using a single curve and the measured response is a good match to an idealized parametric or standardized tone response curve.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Uniformity report: No longer include (meaningless) correlated/closest color temperature. Use “traffic light” visual indicators in conjunction with unambiguous pass/fail messages to allow easy at-a-glance assessment of the results, and also include contrast ratio deviation to fully conform to ISO 12646:2015 and 14861:2015.

						<h3>DisplayCAL 3.3 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Profiling engine enhancements:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>Better multi CPU/multi core support.</strong> Generating high resolution PCS-to-device tables is now taking more advantage of multiple (physical or logical) processors (typical <strong>2x speedup</strong> on a i7 6700K CPU).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Generating a simple high resolution perceptual table is now done by copying the colorimetric table and only generating new input curves. This markedly reduces the processing time needed to create the perceptual table (<strong>6x speedup</strong> on a i7 6700K CPU).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Black point compensation now tries to maintain the whitepoint hue until closer to the black point. This makes curves + matrix profiles in the default configuration (slightly) more accurate as well as the default simple perceptual table of cLUT profiles provide a result that is closer to the colorimetric table.</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> The curves tags of XYZ LUT + matrix profiles will now more closely match the device-to-PCS table response (improves grayscale accuracy of the curves tags and profile generation speed slightly).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> The curves tags of matrix profiles are further optimized for improved grayscale accuracy (possibly slightly reduced overall accuracy if a display device is not very linear).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> XYZ LUT profiles created from small patch sets (79 and 175 patches) with regularly spaced grids (3x3x3+49 and 5x5x5+49) now have improved accuracy due to an alternate forward profiling method that works better for very sparsely sampled data. Most presets now use 5x5x5+49 grid-based patch sets by default that provide a reduction in measurement time at about the same or in some cases even slightly better accuracy than the previously used small patch sets.</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Additional PCS candidate based on the actual measured primaries of the display device for generating high resolution PCS-to-device tables. This may further reduce PCS-to-device table generation time in some cases and lead to better utilization of the available cLUT grid points.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Calibration whitepoint targets other than “As measured” will now also be used as 3D LUT whitepoint target, allowing the use of the visual whitepoint editor to set a custom whitepoint target for 3D LUTs.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Automatically offer to change the 3D LUT rendering intent to relative colorimetric when setting the calibration whitepoint to “As measured”.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Support for madVR's ability to send HDR metadata to the display via nVidia or Windows 10 APIs (i.e. switch a HDR capable display to HDR mode) when creating SMPTE 2084 3D LUTs. Note that you need to have profiled the display in HDR mode as well (currently only possible by manually enabling a display's HDR mode).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>Output levels selection as advanced option and automatic output levels detection.</strong> Note that this cannot detect if you're driving a display that expects full range (0..255) in limited range (16..235), but it can detect if you're driving a display that expects limited range in full range and will adjust the output levels accordingly.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>New experimental profiling patch sequence advanced options.</strong> “Minimize display response delay” is the ArgyllCMS default (same as in previous versions of DisplayCAL). “Maximize lightness difference”, “Maximize luma difference”, “Maximize RGB difference” and “Vary RGB difference” are alternate choices which are aimed at potentially dealing better with displays employing ASBL (automatic static brightness limiting) leading to distorted measurements, and should be used together with display white level drift compensation.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Optional alternate method for creating colorimeter correction matrices that minimizes xy chromaticity difference (four color matrix method).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> The curve viewer and profile information now have the ability to plot tone response curves of RGB device link profiles.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> The white and black level calibration target can now be set by measurement.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> The visual whitepoint editor is now compatible with Chromecast, Web @ localhost, madVR, Prisma and Resolve pattern generators.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> 3D LUT generator ReShade 3.0 compatibility.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Support calibration from WCS profiles embedded in ICC profiles (like the ones created by the Windows Display Color Calibration Tool).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): Detect the Windows Display Color Calibration Tool.</li>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>

							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Incomplete runs are now always saved to a folder named 'incomplete' in the parent directory of the 'storage' directory (previously when creating a profile from existing measurement data, a failed run could overwrite existing files in a source folder that did not reside in the 'storage' directory).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Use a different (numbered) logfile name when starting additional instances of the standalone tools.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> When creating colorimeter correction matrices from existing spectral reference data, use the selected observer.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> Hide the observer selector in the colorimeter correction creation dialog when creating a spectral colorimeter correction as observer isn't applicable in that case.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> Remove the single “Browse...” button from the colorimeter correction creation dialog and add individual file pickers for reference and colorimeter measurement data files.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> When creating colorimeter corrections for “virtual” display devices like madVR or Resolve, offer to specify the actual display model and manufacturer.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> Use smaller increments when paging up/down the black point rate or testchart patches amount sliders.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> Default whitepoint color temperature and chromaticity to 6500K and D65 respectively.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> If you explicitly pause measurements prior to attempting to cancel them, and then dismiss the confirmation dialog, the measurements will no longer automatically resume (unpause) anymore.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Linux: When installing instrument udev rules, backup existing rules to a timestamped backup directory ~/.local/share/DisplayCAL/backup/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS instead of overwriting existing backups in ~/.local/share/DisplayCAL/backup, and automatically add the current user to the 'colord' group (which will be created if nonexistent) if not yet a member.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> Mac OS X: Don't include ID in profile header (stops ColorSync utility from complaining).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): The selected calibration state will not be implicitly (re-)applied every three seconds, but only if a change in the running processes or video card gamma tables is detected. This has been reported to stop hitching on some systems using Intel integrated graphics, and works around an issue with the Windows 10 Creators Update and fullscreen applications (e.g. games) where the calibration state would not be restored automatically when returning to the desktop.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Profile loader (Windows): The profile loader will check whether or not madVR resets the videoLUT and preserve calibration state if not.</li>

							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> <span class="changelog-label trivial"><span>[</span>Trivial<span>]</span></span> The “Install Argyll instrument drivers” menu item in the “Tools” menu is now always enabled (previously, you would need to select the location of the ArgyllCMS executables first, which was counter-intuitive as the driver installer is separate since DisplayCAL 3.1.7).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label ui"><span>[</span>UI<span>]</span></span> <span class="changelog-label cosmetic"><span>[</span>Cosmetic<span>]</span></span> When showing the main window (e.g. after measurements), the progress dialog (if present) could become overlapped by the main window instead of staying in front of it.

						<h3>3.2 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Visual whitepoint editor.</strong> This allows visually adjusting the whitepoint on display devices that lack hardware controls as well as match several displays to one another (or a reference). To use it, set the whitepoint to “Chromaticity” on the “Calibration” tab and click the visual whitepoint editor button (you can open as many visual whitepoint editors simultaneously as you like, so that e.g. one can be left unchanged as reference, while the other can be adjusted to match said reference). The editor window can be put into a distraction-free fullscreen mode by maximizing it (press ESC to leave fullscreen again). Adjust the whitepoint using the controls on the editor tool pane until you have achieved a visual match. Then, place your instrument on the measurement area and click “Measure”. The measured whitepoint will be set as calibration target.</li>
							<li>Another “Auto” testchart slider step with 154 patches (equal to small testchart for LUT profiles) for XYZ LUT + matrix profile type.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Menu overhaul.</strong> Menus are now better organized using categorized sub-menus and some menu items have been moved to more appropriate locations:
								<ul>
									<li>The “Options” menu no longer contains any functionality besides actual options. Advanced options have been moved to a sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Profile creation from existing measurement files or EDID, profile installation as well as profile upload (sharing) functionality can now be found in the “File” menu.</li>
									<li>Most functionality available in the “Tools” menu has been grouped into categorized sub-menus, with some of the less-used functionality now available under a separate “Advanced” sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Measuring the selected testchart, enhancing the effective resolution of a colorimetric PCS-to-device table, loading calibration and resetting the video card gamma tables, detecting displays &amp; instruments, as well as user-initiated spectrometer self-calibration functionality has been moved to the “Tools” menu and respective sub-menus where applicable.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Changed default curves + matrix profile testchart as well as first “Auto” testchart slider step back to pre-3.1.7 chart with 73 patches.</li>
							<li><strong>Better curves + matrix profiles as well as faster computation of XYZ LUT + matrix profiles.</strong> The matrix and shaper curves of gamma + matrix, curves + matrix as well as XYZ LUT + matrix profiles are now generated in separate steps which improves the shape and grayscale neutrality of the curves on less well-behaved displays. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles will compute faster, because the curves and matrix are created from a sub-set of the profiling patches, and take around the same time as XYZ LUT + swapped matrix profiles, resulting in a typical overall computation speed increase of around +33% (+100% if just looking at the time needed when not creating PCS-to-device tables) for a XYZ LUT + matrix profile computed from 1148 patches. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles computed from more patches should see a larger computation speed increase of up to +100% depending on patch count.</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator and non-native madVR network implementation: Determine the computer's local network IP address in a way that is hopefully more reliable across platforms.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Detect and work-around buggy Intel video drivers which, despite reverting to linear gamma tables at certain points (e.g. UAC prompts), will effectively ignore attempts to restore the gamma table calibration if it is considered to be already loaded by the driver.</li>
							<li><strong>Profile loader (Windows): Replaced “Open Windows color management settings...” pop-up menu item with own “Profile associations...” implementation.</strong> This should work better with multi-display configurations in contrast to Windows' braindead built-in counterpart, i.e. display devices will be listed under their EDID name (if available) as well as their viewport position and size on the virtual desktop and not only their often meaningless generic driver name like “PnP-Monitor”. Also, there won't be multiple entries for the same display device or ambiguous “1|2” identifications if there are display devices that are currently not part of the desktop due to being disabled in Windows display settings. Changing profile associations around is of course still using Windows color management functionality, but the custom UI will look and act more sane than what Windows color management settings has to offer.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Clicking the task bar tray icon will now always show up-to-date (at the time of clicking) information in the notification popup even if the profile loader is disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting a new instance of the profile loader will now always attempt to close an already running instance instead of just notifying it, allowing for easy re-starting.</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and later): Installing a profile as system default will now automatically turn off “Use my settings for this device” for the current user, so that if the system default profile is changed by another user, the change is propagated to all users that have opted to use the system default profile (which is the whole point of installing a profile as system default).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spectrometer self-calibration using an i1 Pro or i1 Pro 2 with Argyll &gt;= 1.9 always presented the emissive dark calibration dialog irrespective of measurement mode (but still correctly did a reflective calibration if the measurement mode was one of the high resolution spectrum modes).</li>
							<li>User-initiated spectrometer self-calibration was not performed if “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” was enabled in the “Options” menu and the most recent self-calibration was still fresh.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic: If an update check, colorimeter correction query or profile sharing upload returned a HTTP status code equal to or greater than 400 (server-side error), an unhandled exception was raised instead of presenting a nicer, formatted error dialog (regression of DisplayCAL 3.1.7 instrument driver installer download related changes).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows, cosmetic): Reflect changed display resolution and position in UI (doesn't influence functionality).</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator: Unhandled exception if the system hostname could not be resolved to an IP address.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>3.1.7.3 </h3>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>0install (Linux): <code>(un)install-standalone-tools-icons</code> command was broken with 3.1 release.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Linux): Unhandled exception if oyranos-monitor is present (regression of late initialization change made in 3.1.7).</li>
						</ul>

					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7.2 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: Toggling the “Load calibration on login” checkbox in the profile installation dialog now also toggles preserving calibration state in the profile loader and vice versa, thus actually affecting if calibration is loaded on login or not (this restores functionality that was lost with the initial DisplayCAL 3.1 release).</li>
							<li>Windows: The application, setup and Argyll USB driver installer executables are now digitally signed (starting from October 18, 2016 with SHA-1 digest for 3.1.7.1 and dual SHA-1 and SHA-256 digests for 3.1.7.2 from October 21, 2016).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): User-defined exceptions could be lost if exiting the profile loader followed by (re-)loading settings or restoring defaults in DisplayCAL.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.7.1">2016-10-18 10:00 (UTC) 3.1.7.1 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7.1 </h3>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Setting calibration state to reset video card gamma tables overwrote cached gamma ramps for the 2nd display in a multi-display configuration.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.7">2016-10-04 20:49 (UTC) 3.1.7 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>3D LUT sizes 5x5x5 and 9x9x9.</li>
							<li>JETI spectraval 1511/1501 support (requires ArgyllCMS &gt;= 1.9).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): User-definable exceptions.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Added <code>reset-vcgt</code> scripting command (equivalent to selecting “Reset video card gamma table” from the popup menu).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>“Auto” resolution of PCS-to-device tables is now limited to 45x45x45 to prevent excessive processing times with profiles from “funky” measurements (i.e. due to bad/inaccurate instrument).</li>
							<li>Automatically optimized testcharts now use curves + matrix profiles for preconditioning to prevent a possible hang while creating the preconditioned testchart with LUT-type profiles from sufficiently “badly behaved” displays.</li>
							<li>2nd auto-optimized testchart slider step now defaults to XYZ LUT profile type as well, and the previous patch count was increased from 97 to 271 (necessary for baseline LUT profile accuracy).</li>
							<li>Adjusted curves + matrix testcharts to only include fully saturated RGB and grayscale to prevent tinted neutrals and/or “rollercoaster” curves on not-so-well behaved displays (also reduces testchart patch count and measurement time, but may worsen the resulting profile's overall accuracy).</li>
							<li>Removed near-black and near-white 1% grayscale increments from “video” verification charts.</li>
							<li>Use a 20 second timeout for unresponsive downloads.</li>
							<li>Windows: <strong>Much easier ArgyllCMS instrument driver installation</strong> (for instruments that require it). No need to disable driver signature enforcement under Windows 8/10 anymore. Select “Install ArgyllCMS instrument drivers...” from the “Tools” menu, click “Download &amp; install”, wait briefly for the download to finish (400 KB), confirm the User Access Control popup, done. Note that the driver installer executable is currently not digitally signed (obtaining a suitable certificate from a trusted authority is in progress), but the driver itself is signed as usual. The installer is based on <a href="https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi">libwdi</a>.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Changed <code>apply-profiles</code> scripting command to behave excatly like selecting “Load calibration from current display device profile(s)” from the popup menu, i.e. not only load calibration, but also change the setting.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Also count calibration state being (re)applied when the profile loader state or profile association(s) changes.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Update measurement modes after importing colorimeter corrections. Fixes additional measurement modes for the Spyder4/5 not appearing until the program is restarted or a different instrument is selected first.</li>
							<li>Trivial: Instrument setup was unnecessarily being called twice after downloading ArgyllCMS when the latter wasn't previously detected.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a wxPython bug which prevents launching the application from a path containing non-ASCII characters.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a configuration problem affecting ArgyllCMS 1.9 and 1.9.1 (fixes Spyder2 firmware, additional Spyder4/5 measurement modes, and imported colorimeter corrections not being seen by DisplayCAL if imported via ArgyllCMS 1.9 or 1.9.1).</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.6">2016-08-24 21:33 (UTC) 3.1.6 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.6 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Advanced options to specify maximum content light level for roll-off (use with care!) as well as content colorspace (affects perceptual intent gamut mapping, less so colorimetric).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Increased timeout to launch ArgyllCMS tools to 20 seconds.</li>
							<li>Show failed items when otherwise successfully importing colorimeter corrections, and detect updated CCSS files.</li>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Improve overall saturation preservation.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: When checking for a valid colord device ID, also try with manufacturer omitted.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista and later: Use “known folders” API to determine path to “Downloads” directory.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Slightly too light near-black tones when black output offset was set to below 100%.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC Profile Creator: Undefined variable when creating synthetic profile with custom gamma or BT.1886 and non-zero black level (regression of HDR-related changes made in 3.1.5).</li>
							<li>When loading settings from a profile created with DisplayCAL prior to 3.1.5 and custom 3D LUT tone curve gamma in DisplayCAL 3.1.5, the gamma and output offset controls wouldn't be shown if advanced options weren't enabled until re-selecting the tone curve choice.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Windows 10): Banner would go blank under some Windows 10 configurations when showing the profile or 3D LUT installation dialog.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Linux): Missing backgrounds and wrongly sized combo boxes when wxGTK is built against GTK3.</li>
							<li>Linux: Profile loader autostart entry was installed under wrong (mixed-case) name if installing for the current user, which lead to the loader unnecesarily being run twice if DisplayCAL was installed from a RPM or DEB package. The superfluous loader entry will be automatically removed the next time you install a profile, or you can remove it manually by running <code>rm ~/.config/autostart/z-DisplayCAL-apply-profiles.desktop</code> in a terminal.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: Don't cache device IDs that are not the result of a successful query.</li>
							<li>Windows: Make elevated subprocess calls synchronous. Fixes importing colorimeter corrections system-wide not listing all succesfully imported items on the first use.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>3.1.5 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR: Allow specifying of black output offset for SMPTE 2084.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR: Implemented SMPTE 2084 rolloff according to ITU-R BT.2390.</li>
							<li>HDR: Implemented SMPTE 2084 3D LUT tone mapping (preserve hue and saturation with rolloff).</li>
							<li>HDR: Improved SMPTE 2084 3D LUT perceptual intent rendering (better preserve saturation). Note that colorimetric intent is recommended and will also do tone mapping.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: Increase timeout when querying for newly installed profiles to 20 seconnds.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Minor: HDR peak luminance textbox was sometimes not able to receive focus.</li>
							<li>Minor (Mac OS X): Don't omit ICC files from compressed archives (regression of adding device link profiles as possible 3D LUT output format in DisplayCAL 3.1.3).</li>
						</ul>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.4">2016-07-10 23:35 (UTC) 3.1.4 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.4 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A fourth Rec. 709 encompassing color space variant as a profile connection space candidate for XYZ LUT profiles. May lead to better utilization of PCS-to-device color lookup table grid points in some cases (and thus potentially smaller profiles when the effective resolution is set to the default of “Auto”).</li>
							<li>An option to include legacy serial ports (if any) in detected instruments.</li>
							<li>SMPTE 2084 (HDR) as 3D LUT tone curve choice.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't preserve shaper curves in ICC device link profiles if selected as 3D LUT output format (effectively matching other 3D LUT formats).</li>
							<li>Removed “Prepress” preset due to large overlap with “Softproof”.</li>
							<li>Changed “Softproof” preset to use 5800K whitepoint target (in line with Fogra softproof handbook typical photography workflow suggested starting point value) and automatic black point hue correction.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed SMPTE 2084 to always clip (optionally with roll-off) if peak white is below 10000 cd/m².</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed transition to specified black point of generated profiles to be consistent with BT.1886 black point blending (less gradual transition, blend over to specified black point considerably closer to black).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): If no profile assigned, load implicit linear calibration.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When loading settings from an existing profile, some CIECAM02 advanced profiling options were not recognized correctly.</li>
							<li>Don't accidentally remove the current display profile if ArgyllCMS is older than version 1.1 or the ArgyllCMS version is not included in the first line of output due to interference with QuickKeys under Mac OS X.</li>
							<li>Make sure the ArgyllCMS version is detected even if it isn't contained in the first line of output (fixes ArgyllCMS version not being detected if QuickKeys Input Manager is installed under Mac OS X).</li>
							<li>When loading settings, add 3D LUT input profile to selector if not yet present.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer/profile information: Fix potential division by zero error when graphing unusual curves (e.g. non-monotonic or with very harsh bends).</li>
							<li>Profile information: Reset right pane row background color on each profile load (fixes “named color” profile color swatches sticking even after loading a different profile).</li>

						<h3>3.1.3.1 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated traditional chinese localization (work-in-progress, thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>Windows: If madTPG is set to fullscreen and there's more than one display connected, don't temporarily override fullscreen if interactive display adjustment is enabled.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: If interactive display adjustment is disabled and madTPG is set to fullscreen, show instrument placement countdown messages in madTPG OSD.</li>
							<li>Windows: Restore madTPG fullscreen button state on disconnect if it was temporarily overridden.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Error message when right-clicking the profile loader task tray icon while DisplayCAL is running.</li>

						<h3>3.1.3 </h3>

						<p><strong>If you update from DisplayCAL 3.1/3.1.1/3.1.2 standalone under Windows using the installer</strong>, please close the profile loader manually (if it is running) before running setup - due to an unfortunate bug, the installer may not be able to close and restart the profile loader automatically, which may then require using the task manager to end the profile loader process. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Device link profile as possible 3D LUT output format.</li>
							<li>French ReadMe (thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon).</li>
							<li>Partial traditional chinese localization (work-in-progress, thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>When you change the language in DisplayCAL, the Windows Profile Loader will follow on-the-fly if running.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Capability to specify profile class, technology and colorimetric image state.</li>
							<li>Windows: When the display configuration is changed while DisplayCAL is running, automatically re-enumerate displays, and load calibration if using the profile loader.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting the loader with the <code>--oneshot</code> argument will make it exit after launching.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated ReShade 3D LUT installation instructions in the ReadMe.</li>
							<li>Improved “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” smoothing accuracy slightly.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>Detect CPKeeper (Color Profile Keeper) and HCFR.</li>
									<li>Show any calibration loading errors on startup or display/profile change in a notification popup, and also reflect this with a different icon.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Added semicolon (“;”) to disallowed profile name characters.</li>
							<li>ICC profile objects were leaking memory.</li>
							<li>Windows: Made sure that the virtual console size is not larger than the maximum allowed size (fixes possible inability to launch ArgyllCMS tools on some systems if the Windows scaling factor was equal to or above 175%).</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and newer): Use system-wide profiles if per-user profiles are disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>If Windows calibration management is enabled (not recommended!), correctly reflect the disabled state of the profile loader in the task tray icon and don't load calibration when launching the profile loader (but keep track of profile assignment changes).</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition when “Fix profile associations automatically” is enabled and changing the display configuration, which could lead to wrong profile associations not being fixed.</li>
									<li>Sometimes the loader did not exit cleanly if using <code>taskkill</code> or similar external methods.</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition where the loader could try to access a no longer available display device right after a display configuration change, which resulted in no longer being able to influence the calibration state (requiring a loader restart to fix).</li>
									<li>Profile loader not reacting to display changes under Windows XP.</li>

						<h3>3.1 </h3>

						<h4>dispcalGUI has been renamed to DisplayCAL.</h4>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Linux:</strong> It is recommended that you download the respective <a href="https://displaycal.net/#download">DisplayCAL-0install package</a> for your distribution and install it so that the applications accessible via the menu of your desktop environment are updated properly.</p>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Mac OS X:</strong> It is recommended that you delete existing dispcalGUI application icons, then download the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://displaycal.net/download/DisplayCAL-0install.dmg">DisplayCAL-0install.dmg</a> disk image to get updated applications.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Better HiDPI support.</strong> All text should now be crisp on HiDPI displays (with the exception of axis labels on curve and gamut graphs under Mac OS X). Icons will be scaled according to the scaling factor or DPI set in the display settings under Windows, or the respective (font) scaling or DPI system setting under Linux. Icons will be scaled down or up from their 2x version if a matching size is not available. Note that support for crisp icons in HiDPI mode is currently not available in the GTK3 and Mac OS X port of wxPython/wxWidgets. Also note that if you run a multi-monitor configuration, the application is system-DPI aware but not per-monitor-DPI aware, which is a limitation of wxPython/wxWidgets (under Windows, you will need to log out and back in after changing DPI settings for changes to take effect in DisplayCAL).</li>
							<li>When having created a compressed archive of a profile and related files, it can now also be imported back in via drag'n'drop or the “Load settings...” menu entry and respective button.</li>
							<li>ArgyllCMS can be automatically downloaded and updated.</li>
							<li>A compressed logs archive can be created from the log window.</li>
							<li><strong>Windows: New profile loader.</strong> It will stay in the taskbar tray and automatically reload calibration if the display configuration changes or if the calibration is lost (although fullscreen Direct3D applications can still override the calibration). It can also automatically fix profile associations when switching from a multi-monitor configuration to a single display and vice versa (only under Vista and later). In addition, the profile loader is <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a>-aware and will disable calibration loading if it detects e.g. madTPG or madVR being used by a video player.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Changed default calibration speed from “Medium” to “Fast”. Typically this cuts calibration time in half, while the accuracy difference is negligible at below 0.2 delta E.</li>
							<li>Enabled “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” and smoothing for L*a*b* LUT profiles.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>In some cases, importing colorimeter corrections from the vendor software CD could fail (falling back to downloading them from the web).</li>
							<li>Moving the auto testchart patches slider to a value that changed the profile type did not update BPC accordingly (shaper+matrix defaults to BPC on).</li>
							<li>Minor: Safari/IE messed up positioning of CCT graph vertical axis labels in measurement reports.</li>
							<li>Minor: When clicking the “Install profile” button while not on the 3D LUT tab, and “Create 3D LUT after profiling” is enabled, don't create a 3D LUT.</li>
							<li>Minor: When changing profile type, only change the selected testchart if needed, and default to “Auto” for all profile types.</li>
							<li>Minor: 1st launch defaults were slightly different from what was intended (testchart should be “Auto”).</li>
							<li>Minor: Use OS line separator when writing configuration files.</li>
							<li>Linux: Text and icon sizes should be more consistent accross the application when the system text scaling or DPI has been adjusted (application restart required).</li>
							<li>Linux: Fall back to use the XrandR display name for colord device IDs if EDID is not available.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: madVR test pattern generator interface was prone to connection failures due to a race condition. Also, verifying a madVR 3D LUT didn't work.</li>
